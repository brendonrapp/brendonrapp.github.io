  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.mobiletracker.net/archives/images/palm-treo-650-thumb.jpg" alt="" /> After my last piece of junk cell phone broke (the <a href="http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details.jsp?globalObjectId=55">Motorola V180</a>), I decided to get out of the &ldquo;buying whatever phone Cingular offers cheapest&rdquo; rat race and buy myself a cell phone worthy of owning.</p>

<p>That phone is the Palm Treo 650. I bought a slightly used (but in fantastic shape) Treo off of eBay.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://www.chatteremail.com/">Chatter Email</a>, my email gets &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; to my cell phone, Blackberry style.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://www.pdaapps.com/verichat/">VeriChat</a>, I have a multi-network IM client right on my phone. Even when my phone is asleep with the screen off, I&rsquo;m still logged into AIM and ICQ in the background, and when someone messages me, my phone wakes and alerts me.</p>

<p>With the included Blazer web browser, I&rsquo;ve got an awfully nice bite-sized web browser. I&rsquo;ve bookmarked a number of PDA-friendly websites (ESPN&rsquo;s &ldquo;PocketPC&rdquo; version of their site, Amazon Anywhere, AOL Moviefone WAP, and others).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great. Cingular offers unlimited Internet access for $20, and it&rsquo;s excellent. It&rsquo;s not a 3G phone so I can&rsquo;t get on those super-fast data networks like Verizon&rsquo;s EVDO, but my next smartphone will. As it is, going from regular junky phone to any kind of usable Internet access at all is quite a jump, and Cingular&rsquo;s EDGE network is just fine for email, IM, and some on-the-spot web browsing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love a higher quality camera (it only has a VGA, 0.3 megapixel camera), and faster data support, and maybe a better web browser (Blazer is nice but slow, other browsers on the Palm are either fast and ugly or fast and crashy-unstable). I know I will upgrade a year or so from now and look back and wonder how I lived with some of the &ldquo;lacking&rdquo; features. But right now, I&rsquo;m giddy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this week, EA released Madden 07 for the Xbox, PS2, Xbox 360, and a bunch of other platforms.</p>

<p>I initially picked up the Xbox 360 version, only to end up replacing it with the plain ol' Xbox version.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the difference? Well, they&rsquo;re basically different games. The 360 version is very disappointing, while the Xbox version (while not as pretty) plays much better.</p>

<p>The flaws with the 360 game are numerous. First, the game has a terrible default camera angle, which is way too low and makes it unnecessarily difficult to seeÂ  the sidelines or downfield (and judge distances). Next, the control is highly inferior to the Xbox game. You have much more precise control over your players on the Xbox. MUCH more precise. Furthermore, passing control is shoddy on the 360, lacking the exact pass placement ability of the Xbox. Some minor bugs and glitches on the 360 version add a thin layer of crap to the foundation that just doesn&rsquo;t hold up to scrutiny when compared to the other version of the game bearing the same name.</p>

<p>If you want to play Madden, get it for the Xbox or PS2. It&rsquo;s not just the better version, but it&rsquo;s a GREAT football game - the first one since NFL2K5. It lacks the more &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; graphics and the presentation isn&rsquo;t as shiny, but it&rsquo;s such a great game to play. Best Madden since the Super NES.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I seem to have trouble finding good websites that review electronic music. Most that I find are hopelessly light on content, or focus on a very tiny sliver of the electronic music whole, lacking sufficient perspective. A lot of electronic music reviews I find are afterthoughts buried on sites more compeletely devoted to indie rock.
I do go to <a href="http://igloomag.com/">Igloo Magazine</a> sometimes, but it&rsquo;s not quite what I want.</p>

<p>Anyone know of better places to look?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/media/images/loughlin.jpg" alt="" />What happens when your late night TV viewing consists of Full House and a PBS show on string theory?</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/media/images/morgan-webb.jpg" alt="" />You get a dream about Full House characters getting stuck in an alternate reality (which happens to be evil) using their wits and powers of persuasion to avoid 24 hour lockdown by the evil Full House character counterparts. They then prepare a daring last-second escape and destruction of the evil world (which involved tossing some kind of powder from the non-evil world into a shallow pool of water, and submerging themselves in the water), and pull it off with the aid of a monkey from the evil world that wasn&rsquo;t evil (because monkeys are always good).</p>

<p>This is what my head concocts when left to its own devices.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not so bad, though. The night before last, the dream involved me and a half-naked Morgan Webb hanging in a hotel. If I can figure out the late-night TV combination that creates that, I&rsquo;ll patent it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/splintercell.jpg" alt="Splinter Cell (GameCube)" />A night ago, I had a dream. I dreamt that I was at a GameStop store with Stacey (my fiancee, for any new readers&hellip; &ldquo;new readers&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s funny). I was scoping out the Nintendo DS games, while Stacey was browsing around the GameCube stuff. I didn&rsquo;t find anything very interesting, so I walked over to Stacey. I asked her if she found anything. She turned to me, holding a copy of Splinter Cell for the GameCube. She said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve played all the cute games on the GameCube,  I think I&rsquo;ll try something else and branch out.&rdquo; Everyone at the store was impressed, and I was so proud. We embraced, and kissed, and the camera zoomed out for our cinematic romantic moment.</p>

<p>Today, I told Stacey about the dream.</p>

<p>She ain&rsquo;t buying Splinter Cell. :(</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/topnav_logo.gif" alt="GameStop logo" />In the course of gathering money in order to fund my Nintendo DS purchase, I found myself inside a few GameStop stores. At one such store, I brought in two boxes of old games, systems, controllers, etc, to sell back. There, at the GameStop in Sierra Vista Mall in Clovis, CA, I ran into something I had never seen before.</p>

<p>I met the first decent GameStop employee.</p>

<p>The guy behind the counter was named Brandon. He was pleasant, patient with my army of trade-ins, knowledgeable, and most surprisingly of all, <strong>not incessantly annoying</strong>! I don&rsquo;t know how he ended up working at GameStop. I think he got lost on the way to the Disney Store or something. Anyway, I can say that it was my first actual <em>pleasant</em> shopping experience at a GameStop ever. I preordered two DS Lites with him at that store. Later, the GameStop phone demon (err, automated calling machine) called my phone and asked me to take a survey about my shopping experience. Rather than hang up immediately, as is my usual reflex, I took the few minutes to press the buttons to express my happiness with the experience.</p>

<p>So there you go, Mr. Brandon from the Sierra Vista Mall GameStop. Your fine work got you written about on someone&rsquo;s blog. Here&rsquo;s to you, Real American Hero.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/nintendoDS_logo.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Nintendo DS logo" />Since getting my DS Lite on the 11th, I&rsquo;ve acquired a good many games to go along with it. GameStop had a nice &ldquo;buy 2 used games, get 1 free&rdquo; deal going on, and I took full advantage.</p>

<p>My DS game collection is now: Advance Wars DS, Animal Crossing: Wild World, Brain Age, Castlevania, Kirby: Canvas Curse, Madden 06, Mario Kart DS, Meteos, Metroid Prime: Hunters, New Super Mario Bros,  Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Resident Evil DS, Tetris DS, and Trauma Center: Under the Knife.</p>

<p>Animal Crossing and New Super Mario Bros. are, of course, currently in Stacey&rsquo;s custody.</p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve played Advance Wars the most. It&rsquo;s very much like the GBA games, right down to the same graphics. It plays very nicely, though. I thought stylus control was something I would use a lot, but it&rsquo;s not as easy manipulating small units on the touch screen as one might initially think.</p>

<p>Mario Kart DS is probably the best Mario Kart game to date. It&rsquo;s silky smooth, has online play, and combines elements of other Mario Kart games into a real best-in-show. It also has a Retro Circuit, containing tracks from the SNES, N64, GBA, and Cube versions (and, thoughtfully, each track is actually labeled with which game it came from). The SNES and GBA tracks are very flat compared to the others, but are still fun to race on.
Resident Evil is the classic original RE game. I love it. Yes, RE is flawed, especially the control scheme. That&rsquo;s something that I came to terms with a long time ago. The game has a kind of &ldquo;remix&rdquo; mode that incorporates touch screen elements. Right now, I&rsquo;m just playing through the original classic mode (I only bought the game after finding out that an unaltered classic version was included). The only slight disappointment is that the prerendered backgrounds are obviously very compressed, and don&rsquo;t quite match the visual quality of the original game (light spots on the walls can have a blocky look, not unlike a moderately compressed JPEG image)</p>

<p>Brain Age is fun. I got my &ldquo;brain age&rdquo; in the mid-20s on my second try. I must be a genius. ;)</p>

<p>The others I&rsquo;ve only played slightly or not at all. I am, however, playing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance on the DS Lite. It&rsquo;s amazing how much better the game looks than it did even on my GBA SP. Everything is so ridiculously bright, sharp, and clear. I&rsquo;ve got a few GBA games (FFTA, Metroid Fusion, Fire Emblem) that I&rsquo;ve been wanting to play through, and I think I&rsquo;ll enjoy them a lot more now than on the GBA.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/53/163462725_276e520716_o.jpg" alt="" /> When it comes to games, Stacey has two modes - indifferent and obsessed. She either couldn&rsquo;t care less about a game, or (for those lucky few rare games) she becomes so enamored by them that she MUST have them immediately, and plays them for hours non-stop. This Sunday, as mentioned in the last post, she is getting a Nintendo DS Lite, and I couldn&rsquo;t be more proud. In the meantime, though, she discovered a new game to be obsessed with while fiddling around with the GameCube kiosks at GameStop stores. That game is Chibi-Robo, which (from all I&rsquo;ve seen of it) involves walking around as a miniature robot and collecting trash and mopping up muddy paw prints. Stacey definitely likes the &ldquo;go around and do things&rdquo; genre of games, and her DS Lite will glow late into the evenings playing Animal Crossing in a few days, no doubt.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s also discovered Zuma, a puzzle game on Xbox Live Arcade. And that&rsquo;s a pretty fresh and unique puzzle game. Anyone with a 360 should give the demo a shot.</p>

<p>And, best of all, she&rsquo;s playing Beyond Good and Evil. That&rsquo;s my girl.</p>
