  <div class="entry-content"><p>I seem to have trouble finding good websites that review electronic music. Most that I find are hopelessly light on content, or focus on a very tiny sliver of the electronic music whole, lacking sufficient perspective. A lot of electronic music reviews I find are afterthoughts buried on sites more compeletely devoted to indie rock.
I do go to <a href="http://igloomag.com/">Igloo Magazine</a> sometimes, but it’s not quite what I want.</p>

<p>Anyone know of better places to look?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/media/images/loughlin.jpg" alt="" />What happens when your late night TV viewing consists of Full House and a PBS show on string theory?</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/media/images/morgan-webb.jpg" alt="" />You get a dream about Full House characters getting stuck in an alternate reality (which happens to be evil) using their wits and powers of persuasion to avoid 24 hour lockdown by the evil Full House character counterparts. They then prepare a daring last-second escape and destruction of the evil world (which involved tossing some kind of powder from the non-evil world into a shallow pool of water, and submerging themselves in the water), and pull it off with the aid of a monkey from the evil world that wasn’t evil (because monkeys are always good).</p>

<p>This is what my head concocts when left to its own devices.</p>

<p>It’s not so bad, though. The night before last, the dream involved me and a half-naked Morgan Webb hanging in a hotel. If I can figure out the late-night TV combination that creates that, I’ll patent it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/splintercell.jpg" alt="Splinter Cell (GameCube)" />A night ago, I had a dream. I dreamt that I was at a GameStop store with Stacey (my fiancee, for any new readers… “new readers”, that’s funny). I was scoping out the Nintendo DS games, while Stacey was browsing around the GameCube stuff. I didn’t find anything very interesting, so I walked over to Stacey. I asked her if she found anything. She turned to me, holding a copy of Splinter Cell for the GameCube. She said, “I’ve played all the cute games on the GameCube,  I think I’ll try something else and branch out.” Everyone at the store was impressed, and I was so proud. We embraced, and kissed, and the camera zoomed out for our cinematic romantic moment.</p>

<p>Today, I told Stacey about the dream.</p>

<p>She ain’t buying Splinter Cell. :(</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/topnav_logo.gif" alt="GameStop logo" />In the course of gathering money in order to fund my Nintendo DS purchase, I found myself inside a few GameStop stores. At one such store, I brought in two boxes of old games, systems, controllers, etc, to sell back. There, at the GameStop in Sierra Vista Mall in Clovis, CA, I ran into something I had never seen before.</p>

<p>I met the first decent GameStop employee.</p>

<p>The guy behind the counter was named Brandon. He was pleasant, patient with my army of trade-ins, knowledgeable, and most surprisingly of all, <strong>not incessantly annoying</strong>! I don’t know how he ended up working at GameStop. I think he got lost on the way to the Disney Store or something. Anyway, I can say that it was my first actual <em>pleasant</em> shopping experience at a GameStop ever. I preordered two DS Lites with him at that store. Later, the GameStop phone demon (err, automated calling machine) called my phone and asked me to take a survey about my shopping experience. Rather than hang up immediately, as is my usual reflex, I took the few minutes to press the buttons to express my happiness with the experience.</p>

<p>So there you go, Mr. Brandon from the Sierra Vista Mall GameStop. Your fine work got you written about on someone’s blog. Here’s to you, Real American Hero.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/nintendoDS_logo.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Nintendo DS logo" />Since getting my DS Lite on the 11th, I’ve acquired a good many games to go along with it. GameStop had a nice “buy 2 used games, get 1 free” deal going on, and I took full advantage.</p>

<p>My DS game collection is now: Advance Wars DS, Animal Crossing: Wild World, Brain Age, Castlevania, Kirby: Canvas Curse, Madden 06, Mario Kart DS, Meteos, Metroid Prime: Hunters, New Super Mario Bros,  Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Resident Evil DS, Tetris DS, and Trauma Center: Under the Knife.</p>

<p>Animal Crossing and New Super Mario Bros. are, of course, currently in Stacey’s custody.</p>

<p>So far, I’ve played Advance Wars the most. It’s very much like the GBA games, right down to the same graphics. It plays very nicely, though. I thought stylus control was something I would use a lot, but it’s not as easy manipulating small units on the touch screen as one might initially think.</p>

<p>Mario Kart DS is probably the best Mario Kart game to date. It’s silky smooth, has online play, and combines elements of other Mario Kart games into a real best-in-show. It also has a Retro Circuit, containing tracks from the SNES, N64, GBA, and Cube versions (and, thoughtfully, each track is actually labeled with which game it came from). The SNES and GBA tracks are very flat compared to the others, but are still fun to race on.
Resident Evil is the classic original RE game. I love it. Yes, RE is flawed, especially the control scheme. That’s something that I came to terms with a long time ago. The game has a kind of “remix” mode that incorporates touch screen elements. Right now, I’m just playing through the original classic mode (I only bought the game after finding out that an unaltered classic version was included). The only slight disappointment is that the prerendered backgrounds are obviously very compressed, and don’t quite match the visual quality of the original game (light spots on the walls can have a blocky look, not unlike a moderately compressed JPEG image)</p>

<p>Brain Age is fun. I got my “brain age” in the mid-20s on my second try. I must be a genius. ;)</p>

<p>The others I’ve only played slightly or not at all. I am, however, playing Final Fantasy Tactics Advance on the DS Lite. It’s amazing how much better the game looks than it did even on my GBA SP. Everything is so ridiculously bright, sharp, and clear. I’ve got a few GBA games (FFTA, Metroid Fusion, Fire Emblem) that I’ve been wanting to play through, and I think I’ll enjoy them a lot more now than on the GBA.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/53/163462725_276e520716_o.jpg" alt="" /> When it comes to games, Stacey has two modes - indifferent and obsessed. She either couldn’t care less about a game, or (for those lucky few rare games) she becomes so enamored by them that she MUST have them immediately, and plays them for hours non-stop. This Sunday, as mentioned in the last post, she is getting a Nintendo DS Lite, and I couldn’t be more proud. In the meantime, though, she discovered a new game to be obsessed with while fiddling around with the GameCube kiosks at GameStop stores. That game is Chibi-Robo, which (from all I’ve seen of it) involves walking around as a miniature robot and collecting trash and mopping up muddy paw prints. Stacey definitely likes the “go around and do things” genre of games, and her DS Lite will glow late into the evenings playing Animal Crossing in a few days, no doubt.</p>

<p>She’s also discovered Zuma, a puzzle game on Xbox Live Arcade. And that’s a pretty fresh and unique puzzle game. Anyone with a 360 should give the demo a shot.</p>

<p>And, best of all, she’s playing Beyond Good and Evil. That’s my girl.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of weeks ago, I saw one of my best friends for the first time in years. Ryan had been in the navy and all over the world, and it’s nice to have him back around. We spent a lot of time hanging out in high school. We used to play old PC games with a couple of crappy machines and a null modem cable, thrashing each other in WarCraft (the original, Orcs and Humans, and just a demo version at that) and a pathetic shooter most of you have never heard of - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corridor_7">Corridor 7</a>, from the people that would go on to develop the unforgettably bad BUILD-engine based William Shatner’s <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/william-shatners-tekwar/reviews/reviewerId,5107/">TekWar</a>. Corridor 7 was terrible, but it had multiplayer that functioned, which was good enough for us at the time. It was great talking to Ryan after so long. He agreed to be in the wedding party, despite reservations about having to wear a tux.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/47/162861196_9758c30083_m.jpg" alt="" /> This Sunday sees the US release of the Nintendo DS Lite, and I will be getting one. Stacey will too. I’m actually selling my PSP to help fund it, though I have every intention on buying another PSP later in the future (it’s Sony’s worst-kept secret that a PSP revision is planned for the future, with a large additional internal memory as a likely feature addition). I can live without the PSP (and/or borrow Logan’s from time to time) in the meanwhile. I am very interested in <a href="http://psp.ign.com/articles/709/709489p1.html">Field Commander</a>, <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=65319">LocoRoco</a>, and Killzone: Liberation. Maybe we’ll rent those for the trip to Texas at the end of this month.</p>

<p>In other news, I dumped Gentoo Linux (actually, I just tar’d and bzip’d my root directory up and stored it on my file server) and installed Ubuntu Linux. Ubuntu (and the Kubuntu desktop) has gotten very nice. I always end up back with Gentoo, but this one might <em>finally</em> be the binary distro that lets me live without wanting to go back to a tedious but flexible source-based distro. I especially love the now-very-workable NetworkManager (and KNetworkManager) utility, which is absent in Gentoo.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/54/162867493_4fa9479285_m.jpg" alt="" /> Lastly, my <a href="http://static.flickr.com/54/162867493_4fa9479285_o.jpg">wife-to-be and I</a> have been doing our wedding registries. A lot of stuff falls under the category of “don’t care” for me, so she’s had free reign over a lot of that (like, say, dish towels - just not my area of interest). I have won a few key skirmishes in the war of contested items, though. I got my silverware of choice, and I think we have finally agreed on my choice of bedding. Most stuff, however, is all her, and that’s fine. I’m certain she’ll make our home look beautiful and have it well-stocked with everything we need. I’ve even come around to her choice of <a href="http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/601-9080267-9332126?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;coliid=I2YJN8HKEHGNMB&amp;asin=B000EJ0CD2&amp;colid=2QY7O2JBND0FB&amp;bckreg=cw">dinnerware</a>, which reminds me of “light speed” in the original Star Wars movies.</p>

<p>All is well. I hope to really get deep into writing code over the next couple of weeks. I’ve said that I’m going to do it, but so far it hasn’t quite happened. Starting is the hardest part - once I’m in, I’ll stay coding until I drop.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finals ended last week. That week was, as usual, one of sleep deprivation and constant studying, followed by a hard crash and reboot in the days that follow. I did not sleep either Thursday or Friday night, getting just a couple of hours during the day. After spending the following weekend doing nothing BUT sleeping, I’m finally in that happy “free zone” after the end of the semester but before I need to launch into something else important.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/51/154056436_6cc1a47db8_m.jpg" alt="" /> Gaming has been quite the friend to me over the last few days. My Xbox 360 is trading back and forth between Fight Night and the new Tomb Raider game (which is the first one I’ve enjoyed since the original - even if it’s not the claustrophobic spelunking game that I liked in the original), as well as some downloaded demos. My laptop keeps firing up World of Warcraft, and Civilization IV is just waiting for me to play it again. Stacey, meanwhile, has discovered the joy of Beyond Good &amp; Evil, and plays Kingdom Hearts II when she’s over here.</p>

<p>I’ve also installed Quake 1 and a neat updated Quake client in Linux. It’s got some improved 3D effects that weren’t present in the original game, as well as displaying the whole game in 1680x1050 OpenGL glory. A number of people at <a href="http://www.gamerswithjobs.com">Gamers With Jobs</a> are planning on jumping into some old-school Threewave CTF and Team Fortress. I am so in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In trying to deal with the problem in my last post, I came up with a solution partly inspired by Brandon Wu’s comment.</p>

<p>I’ve re-established the “Progressive Rock” genre tag, for symph, Canterbury, and more or less direct descendents of the ’70s prog rock bands.</p>

<p>All Krautrock has spun-off to a “Krautrock” genre tag. That’s pretty easily maintained, and it’s easy to decide what’s Krautrock and what’s not.</p>

<p>The “Post-Rock” tag is back, this time strictly sticking to post-rock. Recently, it was becoming a catch-all for new “art rock” that wasn’t prog.</p>

<p>And for everything else, there’s the new “Experimental Rock” tag. It’s pretty much a catch-all for anything not strictly “prog”, post-rock, or Krautrock. Some stuff under that tag does tend to get lumped into prog by some, but I’m happy to separate it from the genre of Yes and ELP.</p>

<p>Now each category is much more manageable. Krautrock can be a little light on the ol’ iPod (I’m not carrying around 30 different Krautrock artists, usually), but it’s OK.</p>

<p>I have also taken to re-tagging all of the Album tags of my MP3 collection. Instead of just “Album Name”, they will now read “(Year) Album Name”. The iPod doesn’t show the album years when browsing, and having them ordered chronologically makes more sense than the meaningless alphabetical ordering.</p>

<p>I’m also trying to put the record label and catelog number in the “Comment” field of each MP3, as well as adding the album artwork through iTunes into each MP3’s ID3v2 tag. Once these things are done, I will have quite the nice looking and orderly collection.</p>
