<p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Caspian">Caspian</a> - <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Caspian/The+Four+Trees">The Four Trees</a></p>

<p>2007, <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Dopamine+Records/">Dopamine Records</a></p>

<p>Style: <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/post-rock">post-rock</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/post-rock">post-rock</a>, very <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/post-rock">post-rock</a></p>

<p>Post-rock may be the pizza of the music world - even when it’s bad (or, at the very least, generic), it’s still pretty good.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Caspian/The+Four+Trees">The Four Trees</a> is the debut album from the Massachusetts based band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Caspian">Caspian</a>. The group first gained attention with their first EP, which was well-received if criticized for being too similar to the music of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Explosions+in+the+Sky">Explosions in the Sky</a>. The first few tracks on The Four Trees does little to give the listener the impression that things are any different this time around. However, later tracks show the band incorporating some more elements into their sound, even if those elements too are post-rock staples.</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, if you’ve heard of post-rock, you’ve heard this all before. What’s surprising is how well <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Caspian">Caspian</a> pulls it off anyway. Despite the unshakable familiarity of the whole album, it doesn’t sound like a second-rate copy. The instruments are sharp. The compositions are quite good, with lack of originality being the only immediate complaint to offer. The recording quality is solid and well-mixed, avoiding the messy sound other second-tier post-rock recordings tend to have during the loud crescendos. All in all, it’s a pretty nice package.</p>

<p>Given that this is the group’s first full-length release, there is hope for the future. These guys play too well to stay in the copycat artist camp. Hopefully they come to evolve into a more distinct sound of their own. Heavy fans of the post-rock genre will find plenty to like here, while everyone else should just stay tuned and keep an eye out for album #2.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Grails">Grails</a> - Burning Off Impurities</p>

<p>2007, <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Temporary+Residence/">Temporary Residence</a></p>

<p>Style: <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/post-rock">post-rock</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/psych%20rock">psych rock</a></p>

<p>When Western bands play music with strong non-Western influences (I’m avoiding terms like “ethnic” and “world music” here), the results often fall into a few familiar tracks. There’s the “Van Halen effect” (named after the many ’80s hair metal bands that attempted to copy Van Halen but only cloned the surface elements, without truly understanding the substance of what they were imitating), where the artist only produces a shallow facsimile of the influences pulled from. Then there’s the “oil and water effect”, where the artist attempts to take two very different elements and fails to find a way to mix them into a natural and fluid combination. And then there are those attempts that are just so ham-fisted as to be painfully bad in every way.</p>

<p>When an artist manages to avoid these traps, however, they have an opportunity to create something beautiful. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Grails">Grails</a>’ Burning Off Impurities is a good example of this, an album that incorporates various non-Western influences into a musical style informed by modern psychedelic and post-rock, and soaked in reverb.</p>

<p>Structure is very loose here, and the sustained, reverberated guitars create an ethereal sound. Indeed, the whole album feels like something you don’t directly experience, but only witness through a haze, like barely seeing a boat on the water through thick coastal fog. The experience feels very indirect, and the elements of the music are just out of reach. Tracks are not songs so much as melodies that emerge from the haze like a plane breaking through the clouds, and seep right back into the haze when done. The music, thankfully, is not as awkward and bumbling as my metaphors. :)</p>

<p>It’s very easy to get lost in this album, and although I wouldn’t categorize the tracks as being overly “samey”, the aloof nature of the music can make it easy for the listener to lose focus. Multiple listens are necessary before one can get a good handle on what’s going on, and even still I find me forcing myself to focus on the music and not get lost in the fog. When I am focused, however, the rewards are great. Another great <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Temporary+Residence/">Temporary Residence</a> release. That label is having one hell of a 2007 so far.</p>

<p>Grails - Burning Off Impurities</p>

<p>(live at the Spanish Moon in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on May 5, 2007)</p>

<p>2007, <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Monotreme+Records/">Monotreme Records</a></p>

<p>Style: <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/post-rock">post-rock</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/math%20rock">math rock</a></p>

<p>65daysofstatic has until now been known for a blend of post-rock and dnb-style electronics. With <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/65daysofstatic/The+Destruction+Of+Small+Ideas">The Destruction Of Small Ideas</a> (dammit Last.fm, lowercase the “of”!), the electronics have largely faded into the background, and the intensity has been kicked up in its place. Many people use the word “bludgeon” to describe this album. Indeed, when 65daysofstatic launches into loud wall-of-sound sections, they are driven by rapid-fire drums that certainly suggest blunt force violence. Soft, whisper-like piano lines, sparse but beautiful strings, and strategically placed noise and electronics color the sound into something much more distinct from many generic post-rock acts.</p>

<p>This album takes some time to digest. There is very little repetition, so it can be difficult to make an immediate connection with some of the material. Persistence is rewarded, however, as after a half-dozen listens, everything begins to fall into place. For me, it was like a light switch - I went from nearly taking this off the iPod to loving it to death.</p>

<p>At 61 minutes, this album could certainly have used some trimming. None of the material really screams to be cut (though the guest vocals on the last track do nothing but hinder an otherwise good piece), but everything would have gained from keeping the album at a more manageable size (and creating a bit more balance between the sonic assaults and the softer sections).</p>

<p>Fantastic album. The critical reception has, unfortunately, been spotty at best. Of course, if I wrote about this after only 3 or so spins, I wouldn’t have had much great to say about it either. There’s plenty of substance here, and the patient listener will find plenty to delight in - after a few listens.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Maserati">Maserati</a> - Inventions for the New Season</p>

<p>2007, <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Temporary+Residence/">Temporary Residence</a></p>

<p>Style: <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/post-rock">post-rock</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/neo-krautrock">neo-krautrock</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/space%20rock">space rock</a></p>

<p>Holy smokes!</p>

<p>I’m still reeling from listening to this album all day. <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Temporary+Residence/">Temporary Residence</a>’s site described the album as “a bloodshot, 3AM soundtrack to a Michael Mann movie that hasn’t happened yet; a sweaty, delirious mix of mid-to-late 70s Pink Floyd, German psych-rock, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/krautrock">krautrock</a>, and mid-80s action film scores.”</p>

<p>It is all of those things, and yet none of them. All of these elements are in the mix, but nothing sounds distinctly derivative from any of it. It’s a great fusion of classic prog/space/krautrock with math/post-rock. Dual guitar interplay at times reminds of modern <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/King+Crimson">King Crimson</a>. Spacey atmospherics (usually with a locked-in groove moving things alone) remind of the best of instrumental <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>. Pulsing sounds and steady, repetitious percussion reminds of Neu, or <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Circle">Circle</a>. One of the guitarists is from <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Turing+Machine">Turing Machine</a>, a math-rock band that I like a lot but doesn’t get name-dropped very much. Elements of that band are here too, but while Turing Machine has a bit of a one-dimensional (but still great) sound, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Maserati">Maserati</a> has some range.</p>

<p>Complaints? Well, you could complain that the compositions, while intricate, aren’t necessarily mind-bendingly complex. This would, of course, be missing the point.</p>

<p>I’m confused as to whether this album really is this great, or if it just hits a sweet spot for me. I get concerned when I find myself struggling to offer a critique of something. There has been high praise on the Temporary Residence forum from some people, so I know at least I’m not the only one high on it.</p>

<p>Expect to see this on my end-of-year top 10 list. There’s a great chance that it will be right at the top.</p>

<p>Fantastic, unusual, experimental release, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Amon+Tobin">Amon Tobin</a>’s first true studio album in 5 years. This is very much a departure from his classic studio albums. More often, the album’s tone is evocative of the Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory soundtrack, except without the restrictions that soundtrack pieces have to abide by. It’s cut from a lot of field recordings and real instrumentation, including a track that incorporates the Kronos Quartet. It strays even further away from any dance roots present in previous Amon Tobin studio albums, and has received flak from fans of dance music for it. It’s NOT just an exercise in sound manipulation, though, as Tobin does a great job of incorporating melody, sometimes with very subtle means. This strikes me as a transition record, not yet a final destination. I’m not sure what kind of legs it will have, but so far I think it’s pretty fantastic and I’m glad to see Tobin pushing forward and not settling into familiar patterns.</p>

<p>From the sound of the detractors, you’d think Explosions in the Sky is the new AC/DC, with a ton of same-sounding albums. This is, of course, only their 4th studio album (and you can pretty much forget the 1st one, a not-yet-ready-for-prime-time release that the band resisted reissuing until fan demand became too great to ignore). On the surface, this sounds very much like the past 3 albums, but to leave things at that is to make a very shallow comparison. The last album took away some of the edge from the band’s 2nd album, while this album regains some of that edge in a more concise form. Instrumental buildups are more abbreviated here, and some piano-driven melodies add some extra color to the band’s typical twangy guitar sound. This is an excellent album, I’d probably rank it #2 behind 2001’s “Those Who Tell the Truth….”. It does seem to be a bit of a transitional album, and hopefully the band will continue to diversify around their great core sound.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Circle">Circle</a> (feat. Verde) - Tower: Circle sure releases a lot of albums. Counting Tyrant (released in 2006 in UK but 2007 in US), they’re already up to 3 this year. Tower is very serene and laid back compared to the group’s typical neo-Krautrock jams. This is very subdued and atmospheric, but with a steady yet soft fusion groove to keep things moving along. I saw it compared to early Weather Report and that’s maybe not too far off the mark. Not a challenging listen but a nicely dreamlike one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To celebrate my new employment, Stacey and I bought the Xbox 360 we had planned on putting on our second HDTV. This 360 is all hers.</p>

<p>Stacey has now gotten to the point where she is competant with the dual-stick aiming of console shooters, and the two of us have begun a tour of duty in Rainbow Six: Vegas. Once you give my wonderful 1st grade teaching wife a gun, she settles for nothing less than headshots.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, I now have a job. I’m working part-time at a company that provides services for insurance agents. My duties are primarily data entry, which is fine by me. It’s low key and not mentally taxing, which was important for me so that I wouldn’t feel mentally burned out from work and not be willing to throw my brain into my master’s project.</p>

<p>The best part is that every work day, I leave Salinas and go to Carmel. Carmel is beautiful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve posted before about Stacey and games. Now that we’re married, Stacey’s gaming habit is being helped into high gear.</p>

<p>Stacey already loves playing puzzle games (Zuma!), and novel games like Guitar Hero or Katamari Damacy. However, she has long watched me play shooter games with my friends, and it’s her turn to get in on that action.</p>

<p>So, the first thing she needs is to master the dual-thumbstick aiming of console shooters. Once you have that skill, you can jump from game to game (and with games like Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2 coming out, we will have games to jump to). Thus begins Stacey’s Basic Weapons Training.</p>

<p>Her first game in this training is Halo 2, an easy choice because it has an “Easy” difficulty setting, so that she can learn without getting wasted instantly a la Rainbow Six. Improvement has been steady, and it won’t be long before she finds a comfort zone. It won’t be long before she’s playing online.</p>
