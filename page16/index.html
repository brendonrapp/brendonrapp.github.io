  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK, maybe not so much with the “profit”, but plenty of the “fun”.</p>

<p>I have a history of using old hardware for new purposes. I currently have a media server / router box in my room that is (mostly) a computer that I built for my best friend some 6-7 years ago. I’ve refurbished machines for family members, and torn parts out of spare systems to repair or upgrade others peoples’ systems.</p>

<p>Now, game consoles are getting in on the action. I had planned on modding my Xbox once I got an Xbox 360. And, as of a few days ago, I finally went ahead and did it.</p>

<p>Some research and help from neighborhood friendly <a href="http://www.gamerswithjobs.com">Gamers With Jobs</a> made the entire process very smooth and simple. I found out that I did not, in fact, need a modchip at all. Instead, a “soft mod” would serve all of my purposes easily.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/legion28old/87324056"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/38/87324056_99cca4fefb.jpg" alt="Xbox" /></a> My goals were two in number: to be able to watch IPTV (video podcasts and such) on my television, and to be able to emulate all of my old consoles from the early ’90s on back (so that I can leave that hardware in storage). These goals, as it turned out, were very easily achieved.</p>

<p>To perform the softmod, I needed the Krayzie Ndure Softmod Pack (found on your nearest Bittorrent search engine) and a Pro Action Replay USB. The Pro Action Replay is usually used for downloading “cheat” savegames from the Internet to a memory card that plugs into the Xbox controllers. For my purposes, the save game was a “hack” from the Ndure pack, which would almost completely automate the process of installing a new BIOS and dashboard, as well as backing up the original stuff. All I needed was a copy of the original Splinter Cell (which I never got rid of) and I was off.</p>

<p>After the Ndure install finished, I had a modded Xbox running the Evolution-X dashboard. That allowed me to FTP into the Xbox from my laptop. For emulators and other apps (like Xbox Media Center), one need fire up their IRC client, and head to EFNet and #xbins. Or, if you have a nice legal copy of the Xbox Development Kit (and who doesn’t?), you can just download the source code from the project websites and build it yourself. Either way, once the binaries are built, it’s just a matter of FTP-ing into the Xbox and uploading them into the “Apps” and “Emus” folders.</p>

<p>Xbox Media Center had little trouble getting onto my Samba network and pulling video files from my media server on demand. I tweaked a copy of the <a href="http://linc.homeunix.org:8080/scripts/bashpodder/">Bashpodder</a> podcast client script to download and store video podcasts in a particular folder, and told XBMC to look in that folder. Voila, it streams the video from my server whenever I browse to view a video.</p>

<p>Which leads me to my initial list of must-see video podcasts:
<a href="http://digitallifetv.com/blogs/digitallifetv/default.aspx">DigitalLife TV</a> (Patrick Norton and Robert Heron from TechTV, doing a 45 minute tech show)
<a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/">Rocketboom</a> (a daily 3-minute mini-show, loosely about tech and the Internet, with a very cute anchorwoman)
<a href="http://www.1up.com/flat/Podcasts/vodcasts.xml">1UP TV</a> (good gaming TV)
<a href="http://revision3.com/diggnation">Diggnation</a> (Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht discussing stories from digg.com - probably more enjoyable than digg itself)
<a href="http://www.tikibartv.com/">Tiki Bar TV</a> (ummm… it’s kind of like a recurring skit about a new cocktail each time, except with less structure and more funny. And LaLa is hot)</p>

<p>I have some others subscribed to but not yet viewed.</p>

<p>Anyway - I got some good answers to my question in the last post about games for my parents. They bought Mario Kart, as well as an old copy of Madden for $5 to try out. And I imagine they will go get Mario Tennis after they’ve worn their current stash out a bit more.</p>

<p>Now, I’m waiting on a copy of Beyond Good &amp; Evil to arrive in the mail, as a Christmas present for my girlfriend (which should have been here around Christmas, but the tool I originally ordered it from on Half.com sat around for a week and cancelled the order January 3rd, without a word). But that’s a discussion for another post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think it is safe to say that the GameCube has gone over smashingly well at my parents’ house.</p>

<p>I got a call from my dad this evening, as I was out driving to get some dinner. He informed me that he and my mother had played a full 18 holes of Mario Golf the night before. My mom was up by 10 strokes, but she started to slump and my dad came back to win by a couple of strokes. He was extremely proud of himself. I wasn’t surprised to find out that he has been having fun with it, but I was surprised that he has roped my mom into it too. Not that I blame either of them. GAMES ARE FUN. We gave them some games without a punishing learning curve, and the simplistic GameCube controller, and they’re off to the races. The simple elegance of the GameCube itself, and the comfortable wireless WaveBird controllers, only help matters.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/36/84778363_8020686592_m.jpg" alt="" /> The two of them will be adding some racing games to their collection - Mario Kart obviously, and maybe something else (I’ll have to check the review scores to find something to recommend - any ideas?). I think my dad is also interested in getting a football game (there’s only one choice now - Madden - which thankfully has improved much this year).</p>

<p>Most importantly, I think the two of them are getting over the “fear” (“intimidation” is perhaps more appropriate) of new, high-tech games. Tetris and Dr. Mario may have been long ago, but there’s still simple enough games out there to play.</p>

<p>I will admit, I have come to appreciate Nintendo a bit more. Though their next console will still be the last one I buy (probably, though the lower price might help), I think there is plenty of need for simple games with low barriers to entry. I have been looking forward to the day where the game console world splits into more targeted markets instead of every console duking it out for the right to be everything to everyone.</p>

<p>And if anyone has any ideas of GameCube games that aren’t punishing to the player (ie. “failure” doesn’t equal death and a stop to gameplay), please share them with me. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I admit it - for a long time, I have been using two passwords for everything. Neither were particularly strong passwords - both 8 characters or less, and only one wasn’t all letters. That has finally changed, thanks to a little program called <a href="http://keepass.sourceforge.net/">KeePass</a>.</p>

<p>KeePass is a free, open-source program for creating and managing passwords. It lets you create random passwords of any length, and saves them in an encrypted, password-protected database. The idea is that you memorize only one password (for the database), and then you create a bunch of random passwords that you don’t ever need to actually know - you just access them from KeePass when you need them. It lets you copy a password to the clipboard with a quick click, and then it clears the clipboard after 10 seconds (so that nobody can come along later and repeat the “Paste” action).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/legion28old/79274707"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/39/79274707_b68222dd3e.jpg" alt="KeePass screenshot" /></a></p>

<p>KeePass is a Windows app, but has also been ported to Linux and Mac OS X. I haven’t tried the Mac version yet, but the Linux port is great - a near-perfect replication of the Windows version.</p>

<p>Now I have strong passwords for everything that matters, and even places that don’t. Even if you don’t use it for crazy strong passwords, it is useful for storing usernames and passwords for all your websites - because you can never get the same username and password for every site, and sometimes it’s hard to remember them for sites that you don’t go to everyday. It’s much nicer to have them stored in your KeePass database. And you can copy the database to a thumb drive and take your passwords with you - just install KeePass on the computer that you’re using (probably not a good solution for public terminals, but it’s great for going back and forth between a work PC and a home PC). Since the database is encrypted, you don’t have to worry about losing your thumb drive or having someone hop on your computer and pulling up the database - they’d have to break the encryption first. (Saving passwords in your browser might defeat that, but then at least you’re only exposed if they have physical access to your PC, and you pretty much are exposed in that event anyway).</p>

<p>It’s a great program, and if you get yourself in the habit of using it, it becomes a convenience much more than a hassle - especially for the ability to manage various usernames and passwords for different websites.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My dad (who is actually 51, but the round number 50 makes for a better title) has not been a steady video game player for many years. He was part of the Atari generation, and my early years - some too early to even remember - were spent surrounded by Pac-Man and Berzerk. Somewhere around Super Mario Bros., however, my dad got left behind on the gaming learning curve. Now, he is approaching his retirement, and what’s more, he will have grandchildren somewhere down the road - and any children I have will be game players from the moment they can hold a controller. Not to mention the fact that I expect him to play anything that I get to work on. :)</p>

<p>So, I’m challenging him to get back into playing games. I told him, if he starts now, he’ll be able to play them for the rest of his life. But if he sits and waits longer, it will get to the point where he’s not able to catch up. I’m reminded of the George Bernard Shaw quote, “We do not stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.” Keep playing = stay young, not to mention a never-ending stream of mental challenges to help keep one sharp.</p>

<p>For Christmas, Logan and I packed up his unused GameCube, and threw in a copy of Super Smash Bros. Melee. Then, I went and bought a copy of Mario Golf to go with it. The GameCube was an easy choice for a nice, easy to use system and stable of games. For the games, I wanted ones that don’t terminate gameplay for doing something “wrong” (like falling into a hole). With a game like Mario Golf, you may end up 7 strokes over par, but you get to <em>keep playing</em>. With SSB, you at least get to wail on each other for a while, plus you can set the game on “Very Easy” and the computer pretty much stands there and lets you wail on them. And both are very easy to pick up and don’t require much more than hitting the “A” button to handle the basic gameplay elements.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day, after we opened presents and were waiting for the extended family to come, I hooked up the Cube in my parents’ bedroom. He was able to successfully play a couple of holes of golf, and sure seemed impressed by the visuals that the GameCube pumped out (it’s definitely a long way from Atari).</p>

<p>Hopefully this is the start of a long-running series of posts. I think he’ll have a lot of fun with those two games, and get used to having a controller in his hands again, and manipulating onscreen stuff with a series of buttons. It’s easy to learn to play games, but it helps to have something easy and newbie-friendly to play while you get used to the basics.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s inevitable, so why fight it?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Xbox 360 Premium (which, as mentioned in a previous post, is something I had to acquire myself by camping out in front of Best Buy)</li>
  <li>An additional wireless controller for the 360</li>
  <li>360 games: Perfect Dark Zero, NHL 2K6, Madden NFL 2006</li>
  <li>PSP games: SOCOM: Fireteam Bravo, Hot Shots Golf: Open Tee</li>
  <li>Game development books (Game Programming Gems 3 through 5, Game Code Complete)</li>
  <li>DVD box sets: Deadwood, Entourage, and Coupling (UK)</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://static.flickr.com/6/77466973_af5f77bdcd_o.jpg">red Swingline stapler</a></li>
  <li>Norelco electric razor</li>
  <li>A few books and a couple other individual DVDs</li>
  <li>Some other odds and ends - a couple of shirts, and some stuff I’m forgetting</li>
</ul>

<p>There, now that wasn’t so painful, was it?</p>

<p>By the way, 360 owners: Mutant Storm is awesome. Spend the 800 Marketplace points to get it. I may like it better than the beloved Geometry Wars.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I tried <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> a few months back, and simply did not see the appeal of it. It’s a service that allows you to save bookmarks online. OK, so what? It wasn’t until this past week where I re-visited the site and finally “got it”.</p>

<p>del.icio.us lets you store bookmarks with metadata - that whole “tags” thing that you see popping up in a bunch of different websites. For example, I could bookmark “CollegeFootballNews.com” and I might assign tags like “football” and “college” to it. Then, other sites that I bookmark might get tagged with “football” too. So when I browse by the “football” tag, I see all the websites I’ve tagged as “football”.</p>

<p>Now, if that was it, then it wouldn’t be very interesting. But there are a couple of important features on top of that. First, this is a <em>social</em> bookmarking service. Which means, you can see what other people have bookmarked, how many people have bookmarked any given page, and search for bookmarks. Not only can you dig through random aggregate bookmarks, but you can see bookmarks of individual people, including “subscribing” to bookmark feeds of your friends or people that you find bookmark interesting things. It’s a very neat way to discover new websites, as well as search for sites and sometimes get different/better results than you might with a Google search. Also, you can set certain bookmarks to “private”, so that your porn bookmarks aren’t on display to the world. You naughty readers.</p>

<p>Secondly, every page on del.icio.us contains an RSS feed of the bookmarks on it. If you combine that with Firefox’s “Live Bookmarks” feature, you can have sets of bookmarks inside your browser that you can update from any of your computers, and have those updates show up in Firefox on every other computer you use Firefox on. But even without that, it’s nice to be able to pull up the del.icio.us website and have your bookmarks anywhere.</p>

<p>What I’ve discovered is that the tagging system allows me to store a much larger amount of bookmarks than I am comfortable with in a traditional, in-browser system, and gives me an easy way to find things later. Bookmarks can have many tags, and so instead of just seeing all football sites when browsing the “football” tag, I can narrow it down to college football by looking at the “football” and “college” tags together (“football+college”), and maybe even narrow it down further to sites about draft prospects (“football+college+draft”), etc.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of applications for this that I’ve thought of or already began doing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes I find a website and I want to read it later. I have a tag called “scraps” which I use to tag just those sorts of pages. Oftentimes I would just open a new Firefox tab and leave the old tab on the site to go back to… which would work OK until I’ve done it a few times and then notice Firefox is eating all of my RAM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve bugged Stacey for a long time to maintain a wish list, so that people can know what to buy her for gift-giving occasions. I’ve though about writing a PHP-based “wish list” script but I have too many other projects that I need to spend my time on. She has been copying and pasting links into a Word document, which works OK except I have to have her email it to me anytime I want to see the latest version. Instead, I could have her bookmark those sites and tag them with “wishlist”, which would allow me or anyone else to see her wish list at any time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Subscribing to an RSS feed of the most recent popular bookmarks - giving me a finger on the pulse of the Internet (or, at very least, a steady stream of interesting things to read - this is where a lot of my “scraps” bookmarks come from)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I want to get a lot of friends &amp; net-friends using del.icio.us, if only so that I can “subscribe” to them and check out their bookmarks. Right now, some of the site’s functionality is down, as they are restoring things from a power failure &amp; database corruption. But the basic bookmarking &amp; tagging works, so sign up and get your bookmarks online &amp; tagged. Pretty soon, you’ll find a lot of other new, neat stuff to bookmark.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>2005 is nearly over, and as such, it’s time for reflection. Even though “best of” lists are usually best done around February the following year or so (to catch up on all those late releases or other titles you’ve missed along the way), there is something about the finality of the end of the year that <em>compels</em> one to draw up such a list now. As such, I’ve made a list of the 10 games that I consider to be the “must-play” games of 2005. (I didn’t intentionally make it 10, it just came out that way). I also included 6 games at the end that are titles I expect might be worthy of making the list, but that I haven’t gotten to yet.</p>

<p><strong>The Must-Play Games of 2005:</strong></p>

<p>God of War (PS2) - God of War is fast, brutal, and incredibly fun to play. It’s fairly short, and one run-through is all you’ll ever need to play, but it sets the new high mark for pure action games.</p>

<p>Wipeout Pure (PSP) - This is the game that made me buy a PSP. Wipeout XL for the PlayStation was one of the most fantastic racing games ever, but the Wipeout games that followed it never lived up to that pedigree. For Pure, the game went right back to its XL roots, so much so that it was originally believed to be a remake of that game. Instead, it turned out to be an all-new game that takes the old Wipeout XL gameplay and gives it some oh-so-subtle tweaks and improvements.</p>

<p>Psychonauts (Xbox) - I’m sorry, Tim Schafer, for not believing. When I saw screenshots and read previews of Psychonauts, I didn’t think your quirky, humorous style from the old LucasArts point-and-click adventures would thrive in a 3D platformer. I was wrong. Very wrong. You took the 3D platformer genre (one of the more boring genres of 3D games, IMO) and made it an absolute joy to play.</p>

<p>Civilization IV (PC) - For many people, Civ4 isn’t just “strategy game of the year”, it’s “strategy game of every year until another Civ comes along”. And it’s really hard to argue against that. Not many video or PC games have a shelf life even half as long as a Civilization game. People will be playing this - online and off - very frequently until another Civ game gets released. And for the first time ever, I will be in that group.</p>

<p>Lumines (PSP) - It might not ultimately endure the way Tetris does, but Lumines is one of those few puzzle games that really captured the hearts of gamers. The mixing of music and a neat twist on the “falling blocks” gameplay mechanics made this game a hypnotizing joy. Though many peoples’ addictions were ultimately short-lived, the game still must be played - and if you can keep yourself from overdoing it early and getting burned out on it, it makes a great game to pick up and play anytime.</p>

<p>Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory (Xbox) - I like-a de Splinter Cell. Though the games are coming out with sports-like frequency, the tag-team developer approach gives each game longer than 1 year in development, and the quality has not fallen off yet. Chaos Theory is easily the best Splinter Cell game to date, despite the loss of Dennis Haysbert in the role of Lambert. The single-player campaign was the most flexible one yet, and the online play thrived with not only adversarial play, but a great new co-op mode with a whole co-op only campaign. Here’s hoping the 4th game (coming up soon) continues to raise the bar. Metal Gear Solid is being made irrelevant in the genre.</p>

<p>Indigo Prophecy (Xbox) - Named “Fahrenheit” in its original European market, the game’s name was changed to avoid any potential unwanted association or confusion with Fahrenheit 9/11 (ok then, so why not just call the game “Celsius”?). Indigo Prophecy is, or at least should be, a single-handed revival of the adventure genre. Gone is pointing and clicking, replaced instead with a control system much more this decade. The game strips the item-gathering, inventory-managing tedium out of the genre, and pairs it down to reasonably-logical puzzles and brief button-response action sequences, similar to Shenmue’s “Quick Timer Events”. Unfortunately for us US gamers, the nudity and sex scenes from the European game are stripped out. Never thought I’d be disappointed over such a thing, but that Detective Carla Valenti is one <a href="http://static.flickr.com/37/76666360_06970dab0b_o.jpg">finely</a> <a href="http://static.flickr.com/36/76666361_1529ef5c78_o.jpg">rendered</a> <a href="http://static.flickr.com/40/76666362_fa1fb39337_o.jpg">set of</a> <a href="http://static.flickr.com/36/76666363_3eb2638f03_o.jpg">polygons</a>.</p>

<p>NHL 2K6 (Xbox) - In some ways, this game was a disappointment. The presentation was a big step down from last year, where they had the benefit of the ESPN license. Also, some silly bugs (like in the online lobbies) just annoy and give the game that “not quite a polished product” feeling, AGAIN. But once again, there is one place where 2K rules, and that is the action on the ice. While EA’s NHL game is just a terrible product in terms of actual gameplay, NHL2K6 is the best simulation of hockey in a video game yet. I would be happy with next year’s game if they did almost nothing to the on-ice product, and just spent the time getting the off-the-ice parts of the game up to snuff.</p>

<p>Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved (Xbox 360) - Must-play games don’t have to come on little silver discs or cost $20-50. This one costs $5 and is a direct download over Xbox Live Marketplace, and it should be purchased for every Xbox 360. It’s a simple, hypnotic game that harkens back to the old ’80s arcade experience - but the updated presentation makes all the difference.</p>

<p>SOCOM III: US Navy SEALs (PS2) - Boy, the PS2 hardware is getting looong in the tooth. But when it comes down to it, all the prettier military combat games don’t have the same brilliant level design or neat gameplay modes that SOCOM does. Why games like Ghost Recon haven’t ripped off the Breach game mode, I do not know. As it is, SOCOM still has the ugliest visuals but the best map design and game modes of any online military combat game. Respawn games like Battlefield and Ghost Recon certainly are attractive to the more casual shooter, but the tension of no-respawn gameplay like SOCOM is unmatched.</p>

<p><strong>Honorary Mentions (or: Games That Might Make The List Later, Once I Play Them):</strong></p>

<p>Guitar Hero (PS2) - I am very much looking forward to playing this game. I loved Harmonix’s earlier music-based games (Frequency and Amplitude), and this one looks to be even better.</p>

<p>Shadow of the Colossus (PS2) - It’s sitting in the living room in Logan’s PS2. After I finish the game I’m currently playing, I’m jumping right into this one. I adored Ico, and after watching Logan play this a bit, I know I will be all over this one.</p>

<p>Resident Evil 4 (GameCube) - I’ve only played the first few minutes of this. It’s on everyone’s best-of lists, and it looked neat given the small part that I played. The controls weren’t exactly intuitive, but I imagine they’ll be just fine once I start climbing the learning curve.</p>

<p>Condemned: Criminal Origins (Xbox 360) - Survival forensic horror? Something like that. Given what I’ve read about this game, I am looking very forward to playing it on my nice new 360.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest VIII (PS2) - I don’t play many Japanese RPGs anymore. They used to be my favorite type of game. Androgynous anime men with big swords seemed cool when I was 14. Unfortunately, Japanese RPGs largely seem stuck in that teenage mindset. That said, I will still be giving Dragon Quest VIII a shot. Please, don’t let the story be stupid.</p>

<p>Mario Kart DS (Nintendo DS) - I’ll be getting a DS soon, and this is one of the major reasons why. I bashed Nintendo for not bringing Mario Kart online on the GameCube. Now they do bring Mario Kart online, and it’s on a handheld. Well, it’s a start.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago, I witnessed one of those interesting sequences of events that seem completely puzzling due to the fact that you came into the sequence halfway. Here’s what happened:</p>

<p>As I walked into this Japanese food take-out place, I stood in a short line, waiting to place my order. A man walked from the seating area of the place towards the counter. As he got close, the two girls behind the counter that he walked towards waved their hands at him in a way that you do to tell a person, “no, you misunderstand, you don’t have to do that”… not in a panicked or fearful sense, but just in a customer service sense. He got to the counter, and he slammed down his receipt and a single dime. He looked at them, and said in a slow, drawn-out firm tone: “I will never come in here again.” The girls looked stunned as he turned around and walked back to his seat. I overheard him mutter to someone something about how “she screwed up”, and he took his seat and began eating again.</p>

<p>That’s it, and I have not been able to mentally construct a sequence of events that lead up to that exchange. The dime is an interesting clue. Were they harassing him over ten cents? It sure didn’t seem like they cared about the dime. Perhaps it’s a red herring, and it was just some change he had in his hand and he dropped it as he slammed down the receipt. I would guess that perhaps he was given the wrong order, but he sat back down afterwards and chowed down his food.</p>

<p>Some people have very short fuses when it comes to the people that serve them food. I know Stacey has a bit of a short fuse, a lot shorter than is comfortable for me. But nothing that would end in something like this. Maybe this guy just had a REALLY short fuse about any error in his order or service.</p>

<p>I don’t know. I have no clue really. It’s one of those things that might not be very interesting if given all the details, but in lieu of that, it’s quite puzzling.</p>
