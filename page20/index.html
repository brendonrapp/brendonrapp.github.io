  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been playing Baseball Stars. On my PSP.</p>

<p>And frankly, that’s just cool.</p>

<p>Thanks to some dedicated PSP hackers, owners of PSP with 1.50 firmware or older can execute unsigned code that has been copied to a memory stick. Emulator developers jumped all over that and have released their emulators for the PSP.</p>

<p>So far, I have tried NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and Super NES emulation (I’ll be giving the Sega stuff a shot too soon, once I get my 1GB memory stick in the mail - and if some older consoles get emulators released for the PSP, I’ll load them up too). Super NES and GBA emulation isn’t there yet - both ran too slow to play. NES emulation, however, is great. The emulator I’m using is called <a href="http://psp-news.dcemu.co.uk/nesterjpsp.shtml">NesterJ</a> (as far as I know, the only one available on the PSP). I’ve had great success with many games (Baseball Stars, Zelda, SMB2, Tecmo Bowl, Ring King, Mike Tyson’s Punch Out, etc). Some games do not yet work correctly - sadly, NES Play Action Football is one of these, as is SMB3 and Dr. Mario. A few games refuse to load at all, but I’m not 100% certain if they are good ROM dumps or not.</p>

<p>Game Boy / Game Boy Color emulation appears flawless. Nothing that I tried had any sort of failure or glitch whatsoever, although I did not exactly run the gamut of testing. I did spend some good time with Tetris and Final Fantasy Adventure, both running great and colorized (and FAR more pleasing to look at on a PSP screen than on their original hardware!)</p>

<p>I also played with some non-emulation PSP homebrew software - specifically, a work-in-progress version of a Bejeweled port. It isn’t much more than a half-working game right now, but when it’s finished, it will be a nice little game to have stored on the PSP. And it can’t be long before someone ports a Rogue-like game like Nethack to the system, right? I’m waiting patiently. :)</p>

<p>All of this has made the PSP, a treasure of a toy already in and of itself, even more valuable to me. It’s one thing to emulate old games while chained to your PC. It’s quite another to do so on a light portable handheld system with a knockout of a screen. I don’t care to sit at my laptop and play Baseball Stars, but I’ll do so on a plane or on a long car ride.</p>

<p>(I’d be remiss to fail to mention that Sony is throwing up roadblocks to PSP homebrew software in the form of new firmware updates, which serve little purpose other than to close the holes that the “exploits” use to execute the unsigned software. But make no mistake, any firmware Sony releases is going to be cracked - it just takes time, and avoidance of the newer firmwares until then).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When they said Lumines was addicting, they weren’t kidding.</p>

<p>I bought a PSP yesterday, along with Lumines. I enjoy the game, but can keep my use in control. I made the grave mistake, however, of letting my girlfriend play the game in the car today.</p>

<p>They say you can become addicted to crack as soon as the first time you take it. Well, I think Lumines might need to carry a similar cautionary tale. My girlfriend played Lumines in the 10 minutes it took us to get to our lunchtime destination, and the 10 minutes after lunch for the drive to drop her off back at her place.</p>

<p>As we pulled up to her place, there were no signs of her preparing to stop.</p>

<p>Try as I might, the PSP could not be separated from her hands. Any begging or pleading was met with a sharp, “shut up”. You see, by talking, I was <em>distracting</em> her, and that’s just plain not allowed.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until she “died” that I was able to get the system back. And that was after she attempted to start a new game.</p>

<p>Tonight, I receive an IM, asking if she can come over after work tomorrow night “and play with the PSP?”.</p>

<p>20 minutes to addiction. Q? Entertainment, it would seem, has succeeded in making the new Tetris.</p>

<p><em>Her: “It’s like candy”
Me: “How so?”
Her: “You just want more and more”.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like the idea of jazz crossed with electronic music. I fell in love with the Kammerflimmer Kollectief album “Maander” a couple of years ago. Apparently there’s a lot of action in that space, with so many names like “electro-jazz” and “future jazz” that it’s hard to keep up. I heard 9 Lazy 9 on SomaFM’s Groove Salad radio stream, so I got their first album. It’s 17 tracks of relaxed jazz over laid-back electro beats. A few tracks, like “Brothers of the Red”, let the jazz come out a bit more. Some cuts are a bit too placid and samey, but the high points make it clear why this album was apparently held in high regard when it came out. It does sound like some other albums I’ve heard which came out years later. It’s more in line with what I’m hearing from today’s electronic music than, say, what The Orb was doing at the same time. It’s largely instrumental, with a few whispers or spoken lines sprinkled around. At first, it all kinda ran together… but as I’ve listened more, it has grown on me. I’ll need to check out their more recent albums. Nobody has to twist my arm too hard to check out another album on the Ninjatune label anyway.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don’t generally like to trash on other peoples work (though I have my lapses). I do like to put opinions out there, as people occasionally seem interested in them. So here’s a quick rundown of some podcasts that I recently cut from my subscription list, and why they didn’t make the cut…</p>

<p><strong>Broadcast Gamer:</strong> This is a daily gaming news podcast, about 15-20 minutes long each day. It’s a one-man show and isn’t much more than a reading of the day’s news. Perhaps handy to some people, but not so much if you visit any daily gaming news sites. Not a lot of personal insight to augment the news.</p>

<p><strong>LinuxQuestions.org Podcast</strong> Another one-man show, perhaps of some interest to regulars of the LinuxQuestions.org website, but not much else. They do a new, additional podcast called LQ Radio in which they do a sort of roundtable discussion. I’ve added that to my subscriptions. I’ve only listened to the first part of the first show, and there was certainly some awkwardness there, but it’s not getting the axe just yet. I have a feeling that there’s some meat there.</p>

<p><strong>GottGame:</strong> This one’s little more than a daily 2 minute commercial. The presentation is fantastic, and the guy has a true radio voice, but it’s, well, pretty much just a commercial for the 3 games covered in any given “show”. A quick blurb, some sound clips, and that’s it. Not very interesting, but I would kill to have the same level of production quality in other podcasts.</p>

<p><strong>The Linux Box Show:</strong> Remember, people - radio shows, be they broadcast or podcast, should have SOME entertainment value. There’s some content here, but again, the one-man show is stone cold boring in most cases. Dialogues are fun and interesting, monologues are not. A great deal of what makes The Linux Link Tech Show and LugRadio interesting is the interplay between up to four people. Guests are OK, but having one man on the mic should be avoided at all costs.</p>

<p><strong>SLUG Radio:</strong> I think this one might not be meant for people outside of the user’s group that produces it, and it’d probably be unfair to give it too much heat. But it’s visible on Podcast Alley, so I think it is worth saying something. The most recent show featured a guest giving a speech on programming languages, from binary to assembly to the high level languages of today. Interesting topic, but it was delivered like a lecture. Lectures are boring. I get lectures in class. I want to hear people (plural) talking about the topic, not just one person lecturing. An earlier show also expressed a real misunderstanding about precompiled binary packages, what exactly it is that you’re paying for when you use a “pay” version of a distro, and how the Debian project works (no, they aren’t one of the ones “selling” a distro version - that’s about as opposite of what Debian is about as you can get).</p>

<p><strong>Gamer’s Radio:</strong> I’m not quite sure what’s going on over here. Gamer’s Radio seems to be an erratic mix of a regular show (usually a one-man show, <em>sigh</em>), and listener-submitted content of questionable value. One suggestion - tag your files descriptively. Prefix user-submitted content with some sort of standard prefix, prefix the main show with a standard prefix. The last few entries in the feed look like a random hodgepodge of audio when dumped into my audio player.</p>

<p>In fact, I would like two things taken away from this:</p>

<p>1) Tag your files consistantly and descriptively. If you’re putting a user submitted file into your feed, don’t just name it “Game Review X”. Give the user submitted content a name, and tag it along the lines of: “User Show #001 - Game Review X”.</p>

<p>2) Don’t do a one-man show. Don’t do it. It’s very boring. The number of podcasts are growing and growing, and as the quality threshold rises, fewer people will be interested in listening to what amounts to audio blogs. If you’re going to be a one-man show, spend as much time talking to guests and fielding listener-submitted questions and such as much as possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finished DOOM III on the Xbox, and I enjoyed it immensely. No apologies offered.</p>

<p>DOOM III took a lot of heat as being a massively hyped game that “didn’t deliver”. I played a bit on PC and I too was not really impressed. But something made me get the game on Xbox (partly for the ports of DOOM and DOOM II included in the Collector’s Edition, which apparently outsold the “regular” version).</p>

<p>The simplicity of the straightforward throwback DOOM gameplay translated extremely well to a console experience, IMO. I think it works better as a console game than it does on the PC. It works really well as a pick-up-and-play, living room couch blast-fest. The gameplay is very horizontal - not a lot of aiming high or low, so even those that hate gamepads for first-person shooters can swing it.</p>

<p>The graphics hold up really well. You can’t make it look as good as it does on a high-end PC, but it looked very similar to how it ran for me on a more modest PC. I was floored when I saw how good it looked on the Xbox. I couldn’t have imagined that the transition was going to go so well, but when I read reviews insisting that it was the case, I decided to give it a shot.</p>

<p>What DOOM does better than almost anyone is toying with the player’s psyche. The game knows NOT to ambush players at every possible opportunity. It sets up rooms that just smell like ambush, cuts the lights, lets you hear growls through the walls, and then….. nothing. The game builds anticipation and fear with what you <em>don’t</em> see. Some quick sequences put you in a weird stasis, in which your gun and screen interface disappear, and the room around you changes in a flash of insanity. [Minor spoiler to follow, though it’s just a little side sequence that you could easily miss] One freaky one involved a bathroom in which you may notice that the image in the mirror is actually the <em>opposite</em> of what it should be (ie, the stalls show up on the wrong side, everything’s backwards). When you take the time to get up close and really LOOK at the mirror, you’re gripped with a vision in which your image turns into a sort of zombie, and the room turns red and your ears are filled with the screams of Hell.  [End spoiler section]  The non-combat scare sequences like this are the most unnerving. When you’re not being attacked physically by demons, you’re being attacked psychologically by the sounds and tense pacing. DOOM has a reputation for the “wave of baddies” type of gameplay, but the game is very selective about when and how often it ambushes you. It also does a great job of making the player THINK he is in more danger than he actually is. One thing I noticed is that, in a lot of ambushes, I <em>felt</em> like I got thrashed six ways to Sunday, but in reality, I didn’t take nearly as much damage as I perceived. A very fantastic job.</p>

<p>Also, a nod must be given to the game’s representation of Hell. If Hell exists in any manner in your belief system, then the section may well disturbe you. I exited Hell with one sole thought: <em>I do not want to go there ever again.</em></p>

<p>Multiplayer isn’t worth your time, except perhaps the highly praised co-op version. I haven’t tried co-op yet, but Logan and I might at some point.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The US Senate has <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/51/05-10-2005/abdc0009968d5d93.html">voted in favor of the creation of a federal boxing commission</a>. As I understand it, this would essentially wipe out the influence of entities like the WBA, WBO, and all the rest of the boxing alphabet soup (which has given us nonsense like 3 different heavyweight “champions”). This understanding is advanced by <a href="http://www.ringtalk.com/news/view_article.asp?id=349&amp;cat=4&quot;">a Ringtalk.com article</a> that states that the commission would be “deathblow to sanctioning bodies like the WBC, IBF, WBA, WBO, etc”.</p>

<p>The commission, to be called the USBC (United States Boxing Commission), would give us unified rules on fights and licensing of fighters, standards for judges and referees (something the sport badly needs), standards for standby medical help, and perhaps most important, a single, consistant ranking system of boxers. No more having 20 different rankings of fighters.</p>

<p>This bill, sponsored by Senator John McCain, is a direct attack at the corruption in the sport of boxing and the power structures that facilitate it. It would not only lead to a cleaner sport, but having a single set of actual rankings and titles will make the sport infinitely more fan friendly.</p>

<p>The Senate passed the bill with a voice vote, and now the bill needs to be approved by the House of Representatives. As a boxing fan, my fingers are crossed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The MTV show may have been worthless, but a number of Web sources have the real dirt on the Xbox 360.</p>

<p><a href="http://msxb.wmod.llnwd.net/a274/o2/ourcolony/TheColony_v1_750k.wmv">This video from the OurColony site</a> shows off the system a lot more than MTV did, and features a lot more insight.</p>

<p>Gamespot.com has the best source of info in a big article: <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/features/6124293/index.html?q=1&amp;tag=gs_x360_topslot_click">Xbox 360 Inside and Out</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://xbox.boomtown.net/en_uk/articles/art.view.php?id=8156">An interview with Robbie Bach</a> on Boomtown.net provides another perspective.</p>

<p>Some things of note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Wireless controllers, standard. The system has no wired controller ports. All wireless.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The system features a centralized menu system that can be accessed at any time by pressing the big center “X” button (even during a game). It looks like the Xbox Dashboard with ten times as much functionality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The current design comes with a 20GB hard drive. The system can be used without a hard drive, so there may still be versions of the system sold without hard drives. 64MB memory cards can be used too. Of particular note, the hard drive is external and easily removeable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Custom soundtracks in all games. But not only can you rip music to the hard drive, you can also plug in your portable MP3 player (including Apple’s iPod, shockingly enough), and use playlists from there as your custom playlists in the game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The DVD drive is to be able to read all forms of CD writeable and DVD writeable media, as well as CDs/DVDs that play MP3s and even photo CDs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No announcement on backwards compatability - may be announced at E3. The quiet word seems to be that they have worked hard on having such a feature, but have not yet gotten it to the point where it is 99% functional. It needs to be almost perfect to actually include it as a feature in the system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Xbox Live features a TON of new functionality, from more detailed stat/achievement tracking to more detailed friends/clan setups, as well as a much-needed “Reputation” system (to help you sort out the “good” players from the loser kiddies). The new thing is the idea of a “GamerCard”, which is a listing of your info and all of your online achievements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Xbox Live “Marketplace” for buying downloadable content, including microtransactions for new skins/decals/etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Movies and demos downloadable over Live</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Lots of features that have me excited. All of the Xbox Live stuff has me dying to get the new system.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow. That was terrible.</p>

<p>I thought unveiling the Xbox 360 on TV instead of at E3 was a nice idea, because most people don’t get to attend E3.</p>

<p>But this wasn’t a console unveiling. They didn’t show much at all. Somehow they managed to produce 30 minutes of TV without actually <em>doing</em> anything.</p>
