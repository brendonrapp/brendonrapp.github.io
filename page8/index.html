  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a move somewhat uncharacteristic of me, I went out and bought the new 13” MacBook Pro as soon as they became available for purchase. To understand why, we have to go back in time a little bit, back to…</p>

<h2 id="my-old-flame">My Old Flame</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/12inchpb.jpg" alt="12inchpb" /></p>

<p>As an undergrad in college, I had a 12” aluminum PowerBook. It was the first Mac (or Apple product of any kind, for that matter) that I had ever owned. By college, I had been using Linux for a few years, so the relatively new UNIX-based OS X (it was only up to 10.2, or “Jaguar”, by that time) was intriguing, and the form factor was ideal for lugging between CS classes.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/powerbook-12.jpg" alt="powerbook-12" /></p>

<p>The aluminum PowerBook was a delight. It was light, sturdy, and had a very beautiful LCD screen for its time - especially compared to the old IBM ThinkPad 600E of mine that it replaced (which, by the way, was a tank in its own right). The keyboard reached the length of the body, wasting no space and provided very comfortable full-sized keys. It was the same sized keyboard as the larger PowerBooks; Apple simply made the body big enough to fit it and not a hair wider. Such an efficient use of space.</p>

<p>I was disappointed to see the 12” PowerBook line disappear as quickly as it came - a victim of its own popularity and success. Apple went through major changes, including the nearly unbelievable (but necessary) migration away from the PowerPC architecture to the x86 arch. But the 12” PowerBook never came back.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/INSPIRON-6000.jpg" alt="INSPIRON 6000" /><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/MacBook_13-inch_1_83_GHz_White.jpg" alt="MacBook_13-inch_1_83_GHz_White" /></p>

<p>After a stint with a bulky Dell laptop, I came back to Apple with the 13” white MacBook. It’s a nice machine and had the kind of power and battery life that I needed, but I still longed for a true successor to the 12” PowerBook. I often said that all I wanted was for Apple to take the 12” PowerBook, make it widescreen and Core 2 Duo, and throw in the backlit keyboard that eluded the 12” PB.</p>

<p>Then, Apple announced the new 13” MacBook Pro…</p>

<p>Within days, I was preparing my white MacBook to be listed for sale on Craigslist.</p>

<h2 id="form-factor--weight">Form Factor &amp; Weight</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/macbook-pro-13.png" alt="macbook-pro-13" /></p>

<p>Seeing as I bought this as a replacement for the 13” plastic MacBook, I wasn’t expecting a huge difference in form factor. But while the numbers aren’t impressive on the page, they make quite a difference in hand.</p>

<p>My MacBook weighed 5.2 lbs, and the new 13” MBP weighs 4.5 lbs. It seems as if there’s some threshold between those two numbers, because the MBP has noticeably less “heft”.</p>

<p>Part of the difference is also the sturdiness of the case. Far from unsturdy, the plastic MacBook body still has some give &amp; wiggle like pretty much any other laptop. The aluminum unibody on the MacBook Pro, however, is the epitome of fit and finish. The body has no flex or wiggle to it, and the LED screen stays exactly where you put it.</p>

<p>It has the “chiclet” style keyboard that I was first exposed to on my white 13” MacBook, and have come to really appreciate. From a pure cleanliness standpoint, the fact that the keys don’t create little valleys of crevaces for dust or hair or snack crumbs to go spelunking in is a big plus. I’m also very thrilled to finally have the backlit keys; one of the few features from the PowerBook line which was left off of the 12” PowerBook.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch_large.jpg" alt="apple-macbook-pro-13-inch_large" /></p>

<p>The touchpad is now one big surface with no buttons. Instead, the pad is physically clickable. I was unsure of how I would like this, as I never liked the “tap to click” of Synaptics touchpads on PC laptops. Picking up and re-placing my fingers on the touchpad triggered false clicks constantly, so turning “tapping” off is always the first thing I do after freshly installing Linux or Windows on a PC laptop.</p>

<p>But making the MacBook Pro touchpad click involves actually pushing to make the pad physically “click”. And that makes all the difference in the world. No more false taps. And converting the space that buttons would normally take up into additional touchpad space makes for a HUGE surface area that is simply wonderful. The two-finger scrolling really benefits from the added real estate. It makes casual web browsing with the laptop in your lap (where the machine might not be flat and level like on a desk) a lot more convenient.</p>

<h2 id="beauty-in-led">Beauty in LED</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/macbookaluminum-3.jpg" alt="macbookaluminum-3" /></p>

<p>I couldn’t possibly say enough good things about the LED panel in the MBP. It is** bright**, and crystal clear. LED panels reach instant 100% luminance, as opposed to LCDs which require a bit of “warming up” in order to reach full brightness. It’s a very noticeable difference. It means that dimming the panel to save battery doesn’t leave you with a half-bright screen when you start using it again.</p>

<p>But even compared to a fully warmed-up LCD panel, it’s a night-and-day difference. The LED is just amazingly bright. Like, you walk up to someone that’s using their own laptop, whip out yours, and they say, “holy sh*t, that’s bright!”. Even the damn white Apple logo on the back of the panel shines like it’s trying to pierce through fog and warn ships in the night of the pending coastline.</p>

<p>The beautiful screen definitely requires calibration out of the box. My system, at least, came with a very washed-out image - clearly the result of an overly-high contrast setting. Unfortunately, there isn’t a simple contrast slider to adjust. Fortunately, there is a guided calibration routine that works out pretty well. <strong>You must check the “Expert” checkbox, though!</strong> Otherwise, you won’t be able to do much besides change the color temperature. With the expert checkbox checked, you go through a series of adjustments where you make the inner solid-colored Apple logo as closely as possible match the surrounding alternating shaded lines in appearance. If you understand how these things work (it helps to look off-center or “blur” your vision, so that the alternating line pattern kind of “blends” together into a single color), you’ll come out the other side with an excellent off-the-cuff color calibration. You can’t do much better without investing in a colorimeter.</p>

<h2 id="battery">Battery</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/macbook_pro_13_battery.jpg" alt="macbook_pro_13_battery" /></p>

<p>Battery life is what drove me to buy the white MacBook, and I was elated to see that the 13” MacBook Pro got the built-in lithium polymer battery that was, until that point, exclusive to the 17” MBP (the updated 15” MBP that came out alongside the 13” also got the new battery, whereas the previous 15” MBP lacked it).</p>

<p>I don’t know if the battery will last 7 hours the way Apple claims. I do know it lasts a damn long time - long enough to change my usage patterns. I’m not nearly as tethered to the power cord with this laptop as I was even with the white MacBook. I unplug and walk around with it, and don’t feel like I’m living under a countdown clock.</p>

<h2 id="unix">UNIX</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sexybsd.jpg" alt="sexybsd" />I love UNIX-like OSs. I feel naked without a terminal window and a Bash prompt. Darwin (the open source UNIX OS that the rest of OS X is built on top of) provides a userland that’s mostly based on FreeBSD, but mixes in some GNU and even NetBSD. It’s not bad on its own, but most users from a UNIX background will want to install some tools that aren’t present in Darwin’s base system, or install newer versions than what Darwin comes with.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/unix_hero20071016.png" alt="unix_hero20071016" />Fortunately, there’s two great projects that make this easy: <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a> and <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>. Both have their advantages. MacPorts is very straightforward: there’s one single software tree, everything is built from source, and is generally kept the most up-to-date. Fink, on the other hand, has about twice the number of packages offered, provides binaries (pre-compiled apps, meaning you don’t have to wait for the new programs you’re installing to compile - which can take some time) as well as install-from-source. However, with a binary distribution and two separate source distributions (“stable” and “unstable”), it’s a lot less straightforward - especially if you <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/faq/upgrade-fink.php">run into an issue</a> that has you scratching your head wondering why you’re not seeing the packages you should be. The two can be run in tandem (Fink installs to /sw, and MacPorts to /opt/local, and both strictly avoid interfering with Darwin’s base system), and that’s how I have my system set up.</p>

<p>The terminal emulator included with OS X is nice enough, but I highly recommend <a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/">iTerm</a> instead. That and Firefox are my first downloads on a new Mac.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/windows7_macBookPro.jpg" alt="windows7_macBookPro" /></p>

<p>Windows 7 release candidate installs without issue through Boot Camp. Simply use Boot Camp Assistant to carve out a partition, install from CD, then pop in the Leopard install DVD from inside the Windows environment to install all the necessary drivers.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to choose between OS X and your Boot Camp OS at boot time, install <a href="http://refit.sourceforge.net">rEFIt</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-apple-store-experience">The Apple Store Experience</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/apple-store.jpg" alt="apple-store" /></p>

<p>I’m always uncomfortable around computer salesmen. Particularly at an Apple Store, where the average clientele isn’t expected to be programmers, system builders, or UNIX geeks, let alone all three. The store is geared to serve normal people, as well it should be.</p>

<p>But it did leave me wanting to avoid having to sit through a sales pitch that’s scripted for the tech-unsavvy-but-OMG-shiny crowd. It meant walking into the store and basically pointing at the 13” MacBook Pro and saying, “I want to buy this one. 2.26 GHz. Go get it.” But not quite so gruff. (Also, putting the Terminal icon in some display machines’ docks. Just helping them put their best foot forward).</p>

<p>I will say one thing for the Apple Store - I’ve never overheard the kind of completely falsified garbage that I used to hear salesmen at CompUSA say to customers (before that company came crashing down, leaving good ol’ Fresno with pretty much nowhere to go for computer parts).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought the Morrowind: Game of the Year Edition on Steam, and installed it in Windows 7 on my laptop.</p>

<p>When exiting the game, I would get a black screen. If I alt-tabbed away, I would see a “Morrowind had stopped working” error.</p>

<p>I appear to have fixed this by going to my Morrowind folder, right-clicking on Morrowind.exe and Morrowind Launcher.exe, and setting the Compatibility Mode on both executables to “Windows 2000”. (I first tried Windows XP SP3, but Steam refused to launch the game when set to that).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>5 Things I Think I Think about…</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/re4.jpg" alt="re4" /></p>

<p><strong>1. I think the Wii version is the only one I can stand playing.</strong> This run-through of RE4 was the third time I tried to play the game. The first two false-starts were on the GameCube and the PC. I found the one-stick control style on the GameCube to be abhorant. The PC version looked <em>beautiful</em>, like a completely different game compared to the Cube and Wii versions (just from the high resolution support, really). But even with a 360 gamepad, the game was insistant on mapping movement and aiming to the left stick.</p>

<p>By moving the aiming system to the Wiimote and putting movement on the nunchuk, the Wii version is the only one that uses a true two-sets-of-axes system - you know, the control approach that is the reason every gamepad comes with two analog sticks now. You still can’t move and shoot at the same time, but the player’s left thumb is no longer performing this awkward double-duty while the right thumb twiddles… itself.</p>

<p>The Wiimote aiming scheme isn’t a 1:1 mapped “pointer” like one might intuitively expect. Rather, the Wiimote acts, as one Gamers With Jobs poster describes it, like a giant right analog stick. It’s nice and responsive, and allows for pretty good fine aiming control.</p>

<p>There were some baffling control issues from time to time, though. When aiming through the rifle scope, the Wiimote no longer controls aiming, but rather the nunchuk stick does! This is jarring, of course, because the rest of the game uses the Wiimote for aiming. But what is worse is that the nunchuk stick is <em>very</em> sensitive, in part (I imagine) because it’s only used for movement and camera control throughout the rest of the game. Aiming through the scope with the hyper-sensitive nunchuk stick is a bitch and a half. I understand that the rifle scope is a “fixed view” rather than a floating aim cursor like non-scoped weapons. But there still ought to be an option to aim with the Wiimote, which offers the fine movement control that the sensitive nunchuk stick lacks.</p>

<p>Oh, and to add one little wrinkle: I’m an inverted control sort of person. Not just thumbsticks, either, but mice too. Everything. Aiming with the Wiimote is pretty natural, but at first I found myself having a hard time dealing with the nunchuk’s stick for “looking” around while aiming. Pushing “up” to look down is natural for me, but at the same time it felt at odds with how my right hand moved to go “up”. Trying to switch the nunchuk’s stick back to Normal, however, was disasterous. Eventually, my brain was able to deal with the slight disconnect, and my inverted thumbstick and pointed Wiimote worked in harmony.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/resident_evil_4__wii_edition.jpg" alt="resident_evil_4__wii_edition" /></p>

<p><strong>2. I think the Wiimote-aimed exploding headshot is one of the most satisfying “kills” in any game I’ve played recently.</strong> I could very easily spend these 5 Things just rattling off complaints about the game. In fact, that’s sort of what my first draft of this looked like. So I took a step back and tried to put my finger on why I enjoyed the 16 hours I sunk into this game. I’ve been a fan of previous Resident Evil games, but this one was a very different experience. The one thing that I could point to with zero hesitation was the satisfaction behind every well-placed shot. Being rid of the awkward, uncomfortable feeling of trying to aim with my left thumb (my “non-aiming” thumb, you could say) helped with this feeling, I’m sure.</p>

<p><strong>3. I think the visuals in this port deserved some attention that they didn’t receive.</strong> It probably looks just fine on an SDTV, but blown up on my 47” 1080p panel, even with the Wii component cables, RE4 on the Wii was a jagged, muddy mess. This doesn’t <em>truly</em> come across in screenshots, which don’t look particularly bad. But in action, the game’s great detail was partially lost in the upconversion process.</p>

<p>I understand that the game also makes use of the Wii’s “deflicker” filter, which softens and blurs the image. Some Wii games, like Super Smash Bros. Brawl, make this filter a user-selectable option. RE4, however, has no such option. The blurred image doesn’t do enough to deal with the heavy aliasing. Really, it just blurs away any edge definition, and makes it difficult for things to stand out from the background.</p>

<p>At the very least, I wish the Wii supported higher output resolutions.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/re4_ss01.jpg" alt="re4_ss01" /></p>

<p><strong>4. I think the game really tried to piss me off.</strong>** **None of the sections in this game were unduly difficult. A couple required repeating, but nothing brought progress to a halt or raised frustration levels from excessive challenge. The game was quite adept, though, at doing small things to piss me off.</p>

<p>I’m OK with the tank-like movement in RE games. I’m not OK with areas that have enemies drop from above to land <strong>right next</strong> to me, irritatingly poking at the weaknesses of the RE combat style. (This one wasn’t <em>too</em> bad on the Wii, where I could reach the edges of the screen with the crosshair even before holding the button to go into “aim” mode, but I can’t imagine how much I would have howled at these situtations if I had to deal with the GameCube aiming.)</p>

<p>I’m not OK with enemy and boss types that involve running around with the enemy <em>off the screen</em> the majority of the time. You didn’t make the RE4 camera or combat system for these. Don’t do them. The Garridors (the blind claw guys) and the Gigantes were just <em>awful</em>. Some of the worst moments of the game.</p>

<p>I’m not OK with the maddening inconsistency with how enemies react to taking bullets to the face. Some enemies, like the big dudes with axes, might normally stumble after taking a bullet or two to the dome. But then, randomly, they would decide that they could shrug off a half-dozen hits to the face on their way to closing the gap and slashing you with a devastating axe chop. Look, is a bullet to the face going to deter this guy or not? Don’t making a certain approach to an enemy a winning tactic 90% of the time, but then gash me for half my health the other 10% of the time.</p>

<p>I’m never, <em>ever, ever</em> OK with item boxes that contain a trap instead of an item - in this case, a snake. OK, if it’s a DnD-style game, and detecting traps is part of the game world, fine. But if not, what’s the point? You’re not turning the box into a risk/reward scenario. The player <em>has</em> to hit up every single box. He/she is totally dependent on them for acquiring sufficient supplies to progress. All sticking a snake in there does is punish the player for a choice that he/she <em>has to make</em>. (And yes, I know killing the snake yields a healing item. It doesn’t make the idea any less dumb.)</p>

<p><strong>5. I think I had my best gaming “ticking bomb” scenario ever.</strong> Near the end of the game, there’s a boss fight (Krauser) that requires beating the boss and exiting the “room” before a 3-minute countdown timer hits zero. As I finished off Krauser and bolted for the exit, my time ran awfully low. When I got to the exit door, there was less than a second on the clock. But I had to stick 3 things into the door to reveal a door behind it that I could actually exit through.</p>

<p>I mashed the “A” button as fast as I could. The clock wouldn’t count as the game “placed” the objects, but it would start back up again as soon as one was placed. I mashed faster. By the time the actual exit door was revealed and control returned back to me to register one last pound of the “A” button, the clock was down to 00:00.07 - seven hundredths of a second.</p>

<p>I don’t know how punishing the game is when that clock reaches zero. Maybe there’s a second or so of hesitation, or maybe being all the way by the door was “clear enough” of the blast. Or maybe it was indeed instant death at 00:00.00. I didn’t intend on finding out. All I know is that when I saw Leon finally enter the door with seven hundredths of a second left, I thought to myself, “<strong>oh damn!</strong>”.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tangentially inspired by the <a href="http://www.eat-sleep-game.com">Rebel FM</a> podcast’s “Game Club” episodes, I had a fun idea that I’m torn over whether I should try to get people interested in or not.</p>

<p>The Rebel FM Game Club episodes involve the people on the show playing a certain game that most of them have either not played or not completed, and discussing it on the show. Then they pull ideas from their listeners about what game to do this with next.</p>

<p>I had a vision of what a <em>Legion</em> Game Club would be like. Instead of a group of people playing an old game they’ve missed, it would be a celebration of the multiplayer games nobody else is playing. Whether it’s a 2nd-rate shooter from 5 years ago, or a tacked-on multiplayer mode in a game people only played single-player, we would give that game one shining night of multiplayer action. We’d wallow in the game’s antiquity or general badness,Â  declare someone to be the night’s “winner”, and then quite possibly never speak of it again.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.gamestop.com/common/images/lbox/643751b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://www.listal.com/image/products/220/B00006FWSA/games/counter-strike-x-xbox.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/40/Earth2140Box.jpg/250px-Earth2140Box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I imagine people buying $5 used copies of Nerf Arena Blast off of Amazon, or digging through GameStop’s original Xbox ghetto shelves to find a copy of Conflict: Desert Storm or Outlaw Volleyball or something. Hell, who wouldn’t want to spend <em>one</em> night rocking each other in the Xbox version of Counterstrike? Or playing the known-awful multiplayer modes of Starbreeze’s shooters? And not just shooters - we could play strategy games like Earth 2140 (available on GoG.com!) and stuff like that. Even popular games - as long as they’re old! - would be great, like WarCraft II. <strong>Whatever the people that want to participate vote on as the choice for that month.</strong></p>

<p>It would just be guys tearing ass through the multiplayer games that can be found in the GameStop bargain bins, on GameTap, GoG.com, Steam sales, etc.</p>

<p>I think it would be a blast, but it would require a good group of people who were willing to actually track down and spend a few bucks on cheap old games. Maybe if I served up the idea with sufficient bombast, other people would think it’s cool too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My brother was struggling with a poor wifi connection from his upstairs room to the Airport router downstairs at his house. Given that it is a house he shares with roommates, I figured instead of trying to solve the problem of making wifi reach all ends of the house (especially since the house is in Los Angeles and I am not), I thought a better plan would be to make him a setup that will allow him to pick up wifi signals better, as well as repeat them in his local area.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/UgsQMrfGyTGlfToDjgJXAQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_qL0aKA9MDVY/SeelU6rtzsI/AAAAAAAAAMk/84HCNXQyB2E/s400/118.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>So, inspired by <a href="http://www.i-hacked.com/content/view/261/42/">an article I read a few months back</a>, I cobbled together a little something to do the job. Not quite as elegant a form factor as the article’s tripod-mounted beauty, but a little more sensible for setting up on top of a bookshelf, or carrying around in a duffel bag.</p>

<p>The key components here are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Linksys WRT54GL wifi router</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://shop3.frys.com/%7BlD6LaOuhZ7YvRiH4cTF8hA**.node2%7D/product/5286717">Super Cantenna</a> off-the-shelf “cantenna”-style 2.4 GHz antenna</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DD-WRT firmware <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=185052">build with AutoAP included</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The WRT54GL is the go-to router for anyone that wants to run open source firmware (and even if you’re just a regular wifi user, you want this). Here, we use a build of the DD-WRT firmware with AutoAP built in, provided by the AutoAP Sourceforge project.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Autoap">AutoAP</a> is a brilliant little script that scans for open wifi connections, finds the strongest one that provides you a “live” connection to the Internet, and connects the router to this access point and repeats the signal. It also allows you to set a list of “preferred” networks for AutoAP to prioritize above random points. The easiest way to get AutoAP is to install a firmware image that comes with it. I used the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=185052">AutoAP NG v24 Micro</a> build offered up on AutoAP’s Sourceforge downloads page.</p>

<p>Installation involves simply logging into the router’s default firmware, and using the built-in firmware update function to “update” to the open-source firmware. (The Linksys firmware seems to like IE best - stupid Linksys - so for safety, I flash the firmware through IE. Though I have done it in other browsers before, I have also had the admin panel get pissy on non-IE browsers).</p>

<p>Once the DD-WRT firmware with AutoAP is installed, the router needs to be set up as a repeater. All the instructions you need on this part are here. The idea is to make the router set up to connect to remote access points as a client and repeat their signal, while also offering up its own SSIDÂ  that you connect to. The router’s “physical interface” represents the router’s connection to the remote access point, while the “virtual interface” is your private repeated version of that network, complete with the SSID and encryption of your choosing. This makes things easy, as while the router jumps to different access points, your client machines connect only to your private SSID.</p>

<p>When the router is properly set up to work as a repeater, then AutoAP can be used. AutoAP functionality can be accessed from a web browser at http://routerIP/user/cgi-bin/autoap.cgi. (Bookmark this, as it’s not available through the regular DD-WRT panel). It’s pretty self-explanatory as to how to turn “on” and “off”. When turned on, it will connect to and begin repeating whatever open network it can find with the strongest signal. AutoAP will automatically “fill in” the SSID information of the newly-repeated network in DD-WRT’s Basic Wireless settings tab (what you yourself would fill in if repeating a signal manually - and which you can still do when you switch AutoAP off. This is necessary when you want to repeat a WPA/WPA2 encrypted signal, as AutoAP can only deal with open or WEP-encrypted access pointsÂ  - and only the latter when keys are known).</p>

<p>A repeater works best with a nice high-gain antenna to work with. The <a href="http://shop3.frys.com/%7BlD6LaOuhZ7YvRiH4cTF8hA**.node2%7D/product/5286717">Super Cantenna</a> is a convenient off-the-shelf solution. Unlike the nearest Pringles can, it has a handy tripod that allows you to control tilt and even horizontal-axis rotation (“rolling” the cantenna away from it’s “upright” position can lead to a better signal in some cases). Moreover, it’s got an RP-SMA connector and an RP-TNC adapter. The WRT54GL’s removable antenna connections are RP-TNC connectors, so the included adapter takes care of compatibility. Unscrew the existing antennas (at least one of them - you can leave one on if you want, which you may consider if you find you need an omnidirectional antenna to help extend the reach of your repeated signal), and using the Super Cantenna’s RP-TNC adapter, screw the Cantenna in. Done!</p>

<p>You may want to play around with the “Xmit Power” option in DD-WRT’s Wireless -&gt; Advanced Settings area. Higher can mean better range, but too high can mean excess noise and degraded signal quality. It’s something one has to play around with to find the optimal setting for their environment.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. Perfect for hopping onto the open wifi of the hotel next door, when your hotel proves to be too cheap to provide it themselves. Or, if you’re in a living situation where you don’t necessarily control all the wires, it lets you establish your personal repeated wifi haven.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In honor of <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/writers/peter_king/archive/">Peter King</a>’s “5 Things I Think I Think” musing on the NFL, I present my own “five things” on games I have recently played.</p>

<p>Let’s kick things off with 5 Things I Think I Think about…</p>

<p><img src="http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/EVGA/GeForce_8800_GS/images/farcry.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>1. I think I’m in love with the “sandbox” approach to shooter battles.</strong> The game Far Cry was when I was funneled through hallways and tunnels is probably a game I would have played and enjoyed, even if at a C+, B- level or so. The game Far Cry was when I was allowed to sneak through brush, survey hostiles in the distance, plan a course of action, and execute it, is a game I <em>loved</em>.</p>

<p>For a game that wasn’t strictly a stealth action title, I was surprised at how reasonable and “fair” the enemy’s ability to detect the player was. There were very, very few instances of “how the heck did he ‘see’ me?”. I always felt comfortable that, if there was enough brush in front of me to block them from my view, I would in turn be blocked from their view.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the freedom of being able to approach situations from many different angles. I often eschewed taking vehicles and running through what was clearly a planned “vehicle” sequence, opting instead to creep through the vegetation. It was extremely satisfying to be able to exercise a little <em>creativity</em> in playing the game. So many games really force you to flip the “off” switch in your brain and just follow in-game cues. How many times have you been playing a game and asked yourself, “what am I <em>supposed</em> to do?”, instead of, “how <em>can</em> I approach this?”. As gamers, we’ve become conditioned to try and seek the designed course of action. Years and years of “locked” doors and invisible walls have taught us to turn off the brain and follow the cues.</p>

<p>Given this newfound love for “sandbox” FPS battles, it seems like kismet that the FPS games at the top of my “to-play” list are the following: Crysis, Crysis: Warhead, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky, and Far Cry 2.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/trigen.jpg" alt="trigen" /></p>

<p><strong>2. I think the mutant menace was extremely overstated.</strong> I didn’t play Far Cry back in 2004-05 (save for the demo), but like any forum-dwelling gamer, I’m well aware of its reputation: “a great game, until those damn <em>mutants</em> showed up”. So when the mutants - Trigens - showed up in level 5 (of 20), I thought the jig might be up. I’ve been disciplining myself to pull the plug on games before they outlive their ability to entertain me, as it’s my nature to simply want to <em>finish</em> them anyway. So, from mission 5 onward, we were on orange alert. And a few early encounters almost led to premature deletion, as getting pounced by one of those bastards was essentially insta-death.</p>

<p>But just before it all fell apart, the tides turned. I got a semiautomatic combat shotgun, giving me a capable counter to the pouncing mutants in close encounters. Then the “CryVision” night vision/thermal goggles were acquired, allowing me to hunt <em>them</em> in the outdoor areas. The mutants didn’t dominate the rest of the game, as new enemies are often so prone to do - just when a mutant-heavy sequence would become tiresome, the game would swing back to encounters against theÂ  reasonably clever human AI enemies. And most important, the tunneled indoor areas always gave way to more expansive outdoor segments, returning the game to its bread and butter.</p>

<p>I would have preferred the game sans-mutants, which makes Far Cry 2 appealing, even if it’s quite a different game. But the mutants failed to live up to their game-destroying reputation.</p>

<p><strong>3. I think I like ridiculous, juvenile “sexual content” a little too much.</strong> Please don’t misunderstand me. I know a pathetic appeal to teenage nerd sexual fantasy when I see it. Like the obnoxious fawning from the demon girl in Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. But here’s the thing…</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/farcryval01.jpg" alt="farcryval01" /></p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/farcryval02.jpg" alt="farcryval02" /></p>

<p>… I just don’t care.</p>

<p>I love it. Exaggerated virtual girls with over-the-top, oversexed attitudes and bodies to match… I love it all. No matter how fake, or how transparent the manipulation, I’ll happily wallow in a sea of horny video game girls.</p>

<p><strong>4. I think waiting a few years to play the game was a good idea (also: Steam sales are the best).</strong> When the game was new, playing Far Cry at 1680x1050 with everything cranked to Very High would’ve been a pipe dream. But with a nice midrange 8800 GT, that’s exactly how I played the game, with a framerate that was permanently well above 60 fps. So, so butter smooth. I’m a stickler for framerate. Nothing looks better than a game that runs silky smooth. I have Far Cry 2, and I can get good framerates with decent detail settings right now, but I’m not firing up the game again until I get my new video card.</p>

<p>I bought Far Cry a couple of weekends ago, during Ubisoft’s week of Steam sales. The weekend sale was a 4-pack: Beyond Good and Evil, Far Cry, IL-2 Sturmovik, and Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, all for $9.99. I already owned BG&amp;E and IL-2, but I figured that would just make Far Cry and Dark Messiah $5 each. I definitely got my $5 out of Far Cry.</p>

<p>I’ve never regretted a Steam sale purchase, but I continue to regret purchases I <em>didn’t</em> make (WHY did I not buy Vampire: Bloodlines for $10 back in October??)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/farcry01.jpg" alt="farcry01" /></p>

<p><strong>5. I think I’m glad I played the game on Medium difficulty.</strong> Far Cry was not a forgiving game. I think one of the reasons I was able to live with the mutant presence was because I wasn’t playing on one of the advanced difficulty levels. Playing on harder difficulty levels is something that I’m trying to discipline myself into doing. Too often, I cheat myself out of a rewarding challenge by just going with the default difficulty setting. Although it is fun to just blast through a game with no frustration, I have found that, like a badly coached sports team, I “play down” to the competition. I just cruise through on autopilot, and eventually find certain parts hard because I’m not <em>really</em> trying.</p>

<p>Far Cry was not one of those games. I have no doubt that I could have prevailed on higher difficulty settings, but with a lot more frustration. Certain scenes clearly exist to beat the player senseless and force him/her to re-play the section many times in order to “get it right”. I was certainly annoyed by a couple of them, and I have no doubt that dealing with them on a hard difficulty would’ve put a real dent in my enjoyment of the game. For this title at least, chickening out was the right way to go.</p>
