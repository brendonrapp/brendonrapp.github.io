  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m having a difficult time categorizing my digital music library into genres.</p>

<p>Why does this matter? Because browsing by genre is the easiest way on the iPod to browse through stuff without having to scroll through EVERY artist/album on the device. On a 60GB device, that adds up a lot.</p>

<p>Some categorizations are easy. My “Jazz” collection is relatively small enough to fit together under a single “Jazz” genre. Ambient, IDM, techno, and anything else electronic all fits nicely in “Electronic”.</p>

<p>It’s rock music that’s harder. I’ve got commercial rock music from the 50s through 80s as “Classic Rock”. Commercial rock from the 90s on forward as “Modern Rock”. Indie rock also goes into “Modern Rock”. Anything suitably heavy goes under “Metal”. Right now, my progressive rock, post-rock, and any other experimental rock is under an “Art Rock” heading, which helps sidestep the messy blurry boundaries of experimental rock music, but also creates for a single giant category that almost defeats the whole purpose.</p>

<p>I would like to break up the “Art Rock” a bit more again, but that seems hard. “Post-Rock” is a genre label that seems to be dying out, and there’s a lot of modern experimental rock that just doesn’t seem to fit nicely under “Progressive Rock”. And sometimes “Post-Rock” seems to have very fuzzy borders with “Progressive Rock”. And some of the experimental modern rock often gets associated with more traditional indie rock, even though it probably has more in common with the other stuff I have under “Art Rock”.</p>

<p>Any ideas? I don’t really care to be overly precise (actually, I’ve been heading in the opposite direction with a catch-all like “Art Rock”), but damn if it’s not annoying to have so much stuff under one genre heading when trying to browse on the ol’ iPod.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/46/135247524_f8cef9583b_o.jpg" alt="" /> My black 60GB iPod finally has a name worthy of it: General Zod.</p>

<p>The NFL draft is this weekend. I have two Forward Progress shows to record and get out by Friday. Had a pretty good response to the first show - download numbers were certainly higher than I expected.</p>

<p>I have been watching VH1 Classic a bit lately. The thing that I find most interesting about old music videos is how many of them use a lot of long shots, rather than the rapid-fire series of quick cuts that music videos are known for. It’s funny to think that these old videos are what people looked at as the domain of the short attention span. I just had to record Depeche Mode’s “Enjoy the Silence”. I loved how they cut to a side shot of the singer sitting in his chair, mouthing the line, “words are very unnecessary” on the second repetition of <em>every</em> single chorus.</p>

<p>Are you kneeling before Zod? You might want to get started.</p>

<p>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion on the Xbox 360 is good. Very good. It’s the game I wanted Morrowind to be.</p>

<p>An adult hockey league this summer sounds good.</p>

<p>If the Jaguars draft Mathias Kiawanuka in round 1, I will be mad. Then, I will cry. I hope they’re smarter than that. They <em>have</em> to be.</p>

<p>Who’s going to coach the LA Kings? Getting Dean Lombardi for GM is the first step, now find a coach I like better than Andy Murray (and I liked Murray’s Kings teams).</p>

<p>I’m trying to find the good music in the world of indie rock. It’s like walking through a minefield, only the mines have moody, droopy fans hiding in the shadows.</p>

<p>“The Unit” is an interesting show that doesn’t seem to have a well defined direction. This past episode was quite good, though. Still don’t know if the show will go beyond a random hodgepodge of special-ops machismo, but there are much worse things to use TiVo space on.</p>

<p>Thanks to Internet downloads, I have a couple of BBC shows that I have enjoyed watching during days where there’s nothing good on the ol’ TiVo. One is the new Dr. Who (which is on Sci-Fi Channel too, but I have to catch up first). The other is Spooks. Is there other cool British TV to go download?</p>

<p>One day, I hope to have such a skilled musical ear that I can tell one Radio Massacre International album from another.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/44/115212393_dab79c9ba8.jpg" alt="forward progress logo v1.0" />  I haven’t posted in a long time, but there’s a reason why - I’ve been hard at work on a nice little project.</p>

<p>I’ve created the football podcast that I’ve been wanting someone else to create: <a href="http://www.forwardprogressradio.com">Forward Progress Radio</a>.</p>

<p>Forward Progress Radio is a weekly podcast of NFL news and analysis. Each show will be about 20 minutes long, though these first few are more like 40 minutes because of the amount of stuff there is to cover before the draft.</p>

<p>If you’re a football fan, please check the ‘cast out. It should be showing up in the iTunes directory shortly, if it’s not already there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/43/110809705_f2a75202d1_m.jpg" alt="" /> A couple of nights ago, I finally completed Shadow of the Colossus. As a big fan of Ico, I was both thrilled and somewhat disappointed with this title.</p>

<p>The game is beautiful, and the gameplay is inventive and original. Some of the sequences in the game are extremely memorable, and the whole game was rarely boring. It’s a game that any “real” gamer needs to play, in my opinion. Yet, despite all of that, I think the final product must remain squarely in “B” territory.</p>

<p>My biggest complaint, bar none, is with the game control. In particular, riding the horse was an unnecessary pain in the ass. For starters, the horse sometimes just felt like slowing down for the hell of it. I never knew if I was supposed to hold “X” or just keep pounding it until I cracked the horse’s ribs. Especially in tight areas, I had to beat the horse into glue before he’d finally start moving right. Worse, during colossus battle sequences, he would always seem to find something to run into, instead of intelligently maneuvering around an obstacle and continuing on our way. If that wasn’t enough, when trying to shoot the lizards at the save shrines, he would come running into my way - because heaven forbid I was a few steps away from the damn thing.</p>

<p>The controls off the horse, however, were often annoying too. Some moves - like jumping from one ledge to another - failed to take camera orientation into consideration, so while you think you’re supposed to hold the stick in the direction you want to jump (based on the orientation of what you see on the screen), you really have to hold the stick straight down, no matter what. Of course, if you get it wrong, your character falls to his death. Wonderful. There were a lot of little annoying things like that. There were too many issues that kept me from getting swept up in the grandeur of the game.</p>

<p>I never had that problem with Ico. Sure, Ico wasn’t perfect in those regards either, but there wasn’t anything that kept me from just buying into the game world.</p>

<p>In the end, I see this game as being like a movie that’s extremely innovative and a testament to the craft, but isn’t necessarily the most enjoyable thing to watch. Shadow of the Colossus is plenty fun, but temper expectations somewhat before jumping in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you that read this site are already well aware of the <a href="http://www.gamerswithjobs.com">Gamers With Jobs</a> website. For those that aren’t, it’s the place to go for a live, vibrant community of intelligent gamers. Thanks to very strict (by Internet standards) behavior control, the only people that remain on the site are those that can exhibit a basic level of intellect and good behavior. It’s the kind of place that shouldn’t be rare on the Internet, but is.</p>

<p>What has this to do with me? Well, the GWJ crew recently created an additional website. This one is a “news blog” - intelligent gaming news with a little blog activity from the writers thrown in. This site is called the <a href="http://passthepress.com">Gamers With Jobs Press Pass</a>, and a couple of weeks ago, I joined the crew of writers. It’s a great source for interesting gaming news, without a bunch of rumor mongering or idle speculation. I’m excited to be a part of it, and the activity in recent days has made me start to believe that it will eventually grow quite an audience with its level of discourse and character.</p>

<p>If you’re a gamer, give the site a look. Bookmark it or throw the RSS feed to your aggregator. And if you’re interested in gaming forums without the idiocy, visit the main GWJ site.</p>

<p>Apologies if this post sounds an awful lot like an advertisement. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One week before we had been dating for exactly four years, I asked Stacey to marry me. But not quite so simply.</p>

<p>No, first, she had to run all over town in a “scavenger hunt” patterned after The Amazing Race, complete with Logan serving as cameraman with his fine Sony HD camcorder.</p>

<p>At each stop of the “race”, she would find a relative or friend. Three of her friends came from out of town to participate. She had to do various tasks like find a certain item inside a store, paint a picture, race a go-kart, and (my favorite) participate in a miniature NFL combine, complete with 40-yard-dash time and Wonderlic test. Perhaps the best moment is when she didn’t know what the word “gridiron” referred to, and she ended up asking people in the mall what it meant - finally getting an answer from former Oakland Raider and AFL Hall of Fame receiver Art Powell, who was signing autographs in the mall.</p>

<p>At the end, she found everyone waiting for her at the restaurant at which we had our first date. There, I proposed to her, she accepted (this was a foregone conclusion - she had been pretty much bugging me to hurry up the proposal for some time ), and we all enjoyed a wonderful Japanese food dinner.</p>

<p>Soon, we will shoot some B-roll, and take all of that film and cut it together into a TV-style broadcast, complete with dramatic soundtrack and all that fun stuff. We’ll master it to a DVD, and keep it forever.</p>

<p>Stacey has a <a href="http://queenstacey-25.livejournal.com/60784.html">more complete account</a> of the events on her journal. I don’t have the energy to try and describe it as she did, and I was at “mission control” the whole time anyway. Needless to say, organizing and executing this plan was a LOT of work and planning, and the logistics were my biggest stressing point.</p>

<p>Stacey has also created a <a href="http://staceyandbrendon.weddingannouncer.com/">website at weddingannouncer.com</a> where information of our wedding-to-be will be posted. She’s got some stuff up now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My website (<a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com">economyofeffort.com</a>, in case you’re reading this on one of my blog mirrors) has hosted my personal “wish list” for some time. The idea has been to give friends and relatives an easy way of finding things to buy me on gift-giving occasions.</p>

<p>Finally, a new website has come along to handle wish lists - MasterWish (<a href="http://www.masterwish.com">www.masterwish.com</a>). It makes creating online wish lists a lot easier. The “Wish List” link in my menu to the right will lead to a page that takes you to various sections of my MasterWish list. The site’s got buddy lists, Amazon.com integration, and some other neat features. I had thought about writing a web-based wish list application, but this site renders that exercise unnecessary.</p>

<p>Some people think such lists are tacky, but honestly, nobody wants to give a bad present. Nobody likes trying to buy gifts for someone and having no idea what to get. And perhaps worst of all, nobody wants to buy someone something they already have. I love it when other people have wish lists to go from, if for nothing else but a starting point.</p>

<p>So, anyway, a new website for you all. Do your love ones a favor and put an end to the gift-buying guessing game. And save yourself trips to the store for returning crappy gifts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Generally, I don’t care for the stereotypical geek pursuit of trying to get one’s significant other into the “geek hobbies”. Usually such attempts, while well meaning, are ill conceived. So it is perhaps with a bit of hypocricy that I follow the same pursuit. At least in my case, Stacey has an interest in gaming - one which I am simply trying to locate and help amplify. Stacey has, admirably, broadened her entertainment horizons on many fronts in the time that we’ve been together. I have tried to do my part as well, and in these past 4 years, I have become more intimately familiar with the offerings of the Disney Channel than I ever thought possible. I have a very broad range of entertainment choices, and so it hasn’t been too difficult to find some that Stacey would become interested in and establish some common ground.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/11/93010004_2e8c99a0b2_m.jpg" alt="" /> In terms of games, Stacey was an NES child, much like myself. My NES game stash nearly doubled when she dug up the old games her and her younger brother owned. Although Stacey’s games have tended to be outside of the “hardcore”, some have been reasonably distant from the typical “games girls play” (like The Sims).</p>

<p>Stacey’s currently on a kick for two games. The first is Katamari Damacy. And who doesn’t understand the appeal of that game? Roll a ball around and pick up a bunch of crap. Certainly a “female friendly” game, but a bit more of a gamer’s game than Animal Crossing (another game Stacey was once hooked on, but that’s another topic). She’s progressed to the last 1/4th of the game, and she’s ready to jump into the sequel “We Love Katamari” as soon as possible.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/27/93010003_ca5549f2db_m.jpg" alt="" /> The only time Stacey’s uninterested in Katamari Damacy is when she wants to hook her claws on her other current game of choice: Guitar Hero. Now I love this game a lot. One thing that surprised me is how close it feels to playing an actual guitar. I’ve played the guitar since I was 15 (holy hell that’s been a long time now) and though I’ve never aspired to virtuoso “metal god” status, I can rock more than well enough to star in a radio-rock alternative band. :)  So at least I have a decent idea of what playing a guitar is like. I’m shocked at how well they nailed it with the little Gibson SG style controller. When I progressed to harder songs that required speedy hammer-ons and pull-offs to hit the notes, it felt like rockin’ a real guitar.</p>

<p>Stacey, meanwhile, is not a guitar player, but that sure doesn’t seem to make any difference at all. She doesn’t quite have the finger dexterity of a guitar player, but her face lights up when she does manage to riff her way through a difficult lick. I enjoy the classic rock and metal cuts like “Spanish Castle Magic” and “Symphony of Destruction”, while Stacey likes the newer rock tracks like “Take Me Out”.</p>

<p>So, two games that are somewhere between the hardcore and the typical “girl games”. I really can’t wait to get a copy of Beyond Good &amp; Evil into her hands - if stupid Half.com sellers would stop cancelling my orders, that is (if ya don’t have it, take down the listing, fools).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/23/91579660_7ca7160f65_m.jpg" alt="" /> Last night, I touched Lord Stanley’s Cup. The ECHL All-Star Game was hosted here in Fresno, at the wonderful Save Mart Center. Along for the ride was the Stanley Cup as well as the ECHL’s own prize, the Kelly Cup. Stacey and I had our pictures taken with the Cup. The game was also fun, more for the company (Kate and Kristyn) than the game itself.</p>

<p>I have started experimenting with Python and the pygame library, in order to create a quick puzzle game. I need to build up a portfolio of demos, and so I am going to learn some new languages and libraries along the way. I’d be so comfortable just jumping into C++ and OpenGL to do everything, but when it comes to skill sets, Wider Is Better.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/11/91579661_655e379883_m.jpg" alt="" /> GameFly sent me the next game I had in my queue: Peter Jackson’s King Kong for the Xbox 360. I’ve played it for about half an hour. Very pretty game, seems like a well-executed concept too. One complaint: playing it on my VGA monitor in 1280x1024, the picture appears as if it is rendered in 16:9 but then letterboxed on top of that too. The viewing size is VERY short. I’ve noticed a few graphical gotchas in playing the 360 on a VGA display, rather than an SDTV or an HDTV. I appreciate it when games are letterboxed, but I think there’s something funky going on in this case. No matter - I’ll still play through anything Michel Ansel (Beyond Good and Evil) creates from here on out.</p>
