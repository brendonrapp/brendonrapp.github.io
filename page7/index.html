<p>Hosted by the tech startup venture firm <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>, it should be no surprise that Hacker News has plenty of stories about tech startups, as well as programming and other “hacker” topics.</p>

<p>It’s become my go-to daily tech site. I still check Slashdot semi-daily but have long ceased taking part in the conversations. I recently started reading Reddit, though mostly just the programming page (or “Progit”), as there’s a lot of dumb stuff in other Reddit sections. But HN is better than any of those at aggregating stories of interest and sparking conversations with high signal-to-noise ratios. HN discussion threads are extremely no-nonsense and lacks that “in-joke” atmosphere of those other sites.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/sirius-nfl-radio.jpg" alt="sirius-nfl-radio" />I love SIRIUS NFL Radio. The shows on SIRIUS NFL Radio and the availability of radio broadcasts for all NFL games is the prime reason why I have an XM subscription, despite having more podcasts &amp; music on my iPod than I could possibly listen to. I remember in past year, traveling during the NFL playoffs (they take place during the holidays, after all) and trying to listen to games on static-y AM radio stations. No more. In two of the past 3 years, I’ve had to travel during the draft, too. SIRIUS XM and SIRIUS NFL Radio ensure I can keep up with the NFL while I’m stuck in my truck.</p>

<p>But one particular SIRIUS NFL Radio show stands above the rest. It’s Movin’ the Chains, with Pat Kirwan and Tim Ryan.</p>

<p>[caption id=”attachment_418” align=”aligncenter” width=”180” caption=”Pat Kirwan”]<img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/pat-kirwan.jpg" alt="pat kirwan" />[/caption]</p>

<p>[caption id=”attachment_419” align=”aligncenter” width=”200” caption=”Tim Ryan”]<img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/TimRyan_inside1.jpg" alt="Tim Ryan" />[/caption]</p>

<p>Ryan was a defensive linemen for the Bears in the early ’90s. Kirwan’s career went from scouting to assistant coaching to director of players administration (contract / salary cap guy) for the Jets.</p>

<p>Their show is geared toward the fan that wants to understand how offensive and defensive schemes work, how contracts and the salary cap actually work, etc.Â  They’re not the ones who talk about Michael Vick all day.</p>

<p>They pride themselves on making their listeners think like GMs and coaches. It’s the kindof in-depth football eye that is sorely lacking in sports media.</p>

<p>Movin’ the Chains airs from 3-7pm Eastern (12-4pm Pacific) Monday through Friday, and re-broadcasts again late at night.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it misses both my commute hours, but I get to listen at lunch, and online at my desk.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One thing I forgot to include in the previous post:</p>

<p>Either Dan never had our MySQL server’s root password, or he lost it along the way. You’d think he’d, I don’t know, ask someone for it, but no. So, instead of creating new databases for each new site (which he was unable to do without root or another privileged user), he just jammed all the tables for whatever new site he was making into an existing database that he already had access to. So we’ve got a database that’s for a registration page for some corporate event in 2007 (and is named as such) that is packed full of tables for a whole mess of other sites.</p>

<p><em>sigh</em>… yeah…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I work for a small design studio. Their core business is creating logos, designing signage for corporate events, and all that jazz. Over the past few years, they’ve found clients wanting more and more electronic-based content from them. First it was email blasts and static websites, then they wanted websites that did more than just serve up static content, and pretty soon it became web applications and even small desktop applications. Hence the creation of the job which I now fill.</p>

<p>I wasn’t the first one to fill the job. A couple of guys came before me. My immediate predecessor, we’ll call “Dan”. Dan was not particularly beloved. On the contrary, it was those oh-so-important “people skills” (or lack thereof) that led to his, shall we say, unscheduled exit from the position. My first week on the job ended with me getting the raise that would have been saved for after my 3 month performance review, helped in no small part to solving problems in that first week that had been long-standing issues. Most importantly, I was Not Dan.</p>

<p>I recently read a cute little article linked on Hacker News and reddit: <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/yacoset/Home/signs-that-you-re-a-bad-programmer">Signs that you’re a bad programmer</a>. A lot of these can be applied to the code Dan left behind. Particularly, #2: “Poor understanding of the language’s programming mode”, and its first symptom: “Using whatever syntax is necessary to break out of the model, then writing the remainder of the program in their familiar language’s style”.</p>

<p>Dan apparently got started as a FORTRAN programmer back in the day. It’s clear that he never really understood PHP. One of the most contentious parts of PHP development is mixing PHP code alongside HTML markup. Whether the HTML is separated out in templates, mixed with inline PHP, stored entirely in echo statements or HEREDOCs, or even just written there in the file after “jumping out” of PHP mode, there’s a number of ways to approach the issue of PHP’s coexistence with HTML markup.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the language’s flexibility means approaches like Dan’s are possible. Dan clearly never quite wrapped his head around the practices I mentioned above. Instead, his concept of HTML within PHP was to wrap all HTML generation inside of tiny PHP functions. Here’s an example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>startTable("725", "0", "", "id=addTable");
 startRow("center","2","","","noPad");
 if($assId) {
 displayButton("Update Record", "what");
 } else {
 displayButton("Add Job", "what");
 }
 displayButton("Reset", "what", "reset");
 endRow();
 startRow("center","2","","","","top");
 echo "&lt;b&gt;Attach File:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt; ";
 displayFormItem("file", "fileNam");
 displayButton("Upload", "what");
 endRow();
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This generates the HTML:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;&lt;span&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; width&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;"725" &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;addTable &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;"0" &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cellpadding&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;"0" &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cellspacing&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;"0"&lt;/span&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;span&gt;tr&lt;/span&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;span&gt;td&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; class&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;noPad &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;align&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;center &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;colspan&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;span&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; type&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;submit &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;"what" &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;"Update Record"&lt;/span&gt;&gt;
&lt;/&lt;span&gt;td&lt;/span&gt;&gt;&lt;/&lt;span&gt;tr&lt;/span&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;span&gt;tr&lt;/span&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;span&gt;td&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; align&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;center &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;valign&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;"top" &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;colspan&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;span&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&gt;Attach File:&amp;&lt;span&gt;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/&lt;span&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;span&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; type&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;file &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;"fileNam" &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;&lt;span&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; type&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;submit &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;"what" &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;"Upload"&lt;/span&gt;&gt;
&lt;/&lt;span&gt;td&lt;/span&gt;&gt;&lt;/&lt;span&gt;tr&lt;/span&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Yes, instead of simply writing the HTML, everything is stuck in a function. “endRow()”, for example, is literally nothing more than an echo statement for “&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;”. Every tag related to HTML tables has a function, some of which accept a ton of possible arguments for every possible thing you might want to put into that tag (a CSS class, id, border, inline CSS, etc). startRow() takes up to 7 arguments. Reading Dan’s awful code means needing to remember what those arguments are (and what order they’re in), as opposed to simply reading the very clear HTML that they spit out. What are those blanks for arguments #3 and #4 for in the startRow on line 2?Â  They’re some potential &lt;td&gt; attributes (because, despite being “startRow”, the function echoes &lt;tr&gt; with no attributes, and then echoes the first &lt;td&gt;, and all these attributes belong to that first &lt;td&gt; tag). In this case, they’re attributes that aren’t being used. Which attributes? Who knows? You’d have to go look at the definition of startRow. (Also note: this isn’t a worst-case example. This is a pretty tame example of the kind of crap Dan did like this.)</p>

<p>PHP can be useful in HTML generation - using Zend_Form from the Zend Framework, for example, can be very handy for creating forms with validation. Dan, however, wrapped trivial HTML into PHP functions, providing <em>absolutely no</em> additional value of their own, while unnecessarily increasing complexity and destroying readability.</p>

<p>That’s not the only gift Dan left behind, of course. Relative paths seemed to confuse Dan greatly. That meant the use of a lot of unnecessary absolute paths. It also meant that Dan would take his “lib” folder, which stored all his library code, and <em>copy it into subdirectories</em> so that the relative path “lib/” would still be valid, as opposed to usingÂ  “/lib/” or “../lib/” (or, on the HTML side, the <base /> tag. Dan and <base /> have never met.)</p>

<p>These are just immediate things I ran into today, when fixing some old Dan code. It should come as no surprise that, even ignoring the “WTFs” like these, Dan Code (tm) is pretty bad code. None of it is shocking enough to be TheDailyWTF material, but it gets a small moment of recognition here today.</p>

<p>Now I hate Dan too.</p>

<p>(Side note: one of the most frightening parts of entering the work force was doing so with no professional programming experience. I’d been writing code nonstop since entering college, but it was a constant flurry of jumping from language to language, paradigm to paradigm, and no settling in and mastering one development technology. That’s a <strong>good</strong> academic approach, as it breeds the ability to rapidly pick up new technologies, and develops an understanding that separates a concept from its implementation in a specific language… but it’s no fun to then go out and see job postings wanting X years of experience all centered around one language. That blow is softened when, even in your greenness, you’re still better than the guy that was there before you.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you own an iPod and listen to complete albums, but also have mix playlists, then you know the problem very well.</p>

<p>[caption id=”attachment_374” align=”aligncenter” width=”280” caption=”This image should not be taken as an endorsement of Nelly Furtado’s music. I couldn’t find an iPod Classic Cover Flow image to steal that had Made Out of Babies on it.”]<img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/ipod_classic_2.jpg" alt="This image should not be taken as an endorsement of Nelly Furdado's music. I couldn't find an iPod Classic Cover Flow image to steal that had Mouth of the Architect on it." />[/caption]</p>

<p>You’d like to be able to browse through your albums, but the Artist, Album, Cover Flow, etc views are cluttered with the artist and album names from your mix playlists.</p>

<p>Tons and tons of “albums” with all of 1 or 2 tracks in there, mixed among your actual full albums.</p>

<p>It is my assertion that players like the iPod should have an “album browser”, which is smart enough to only display complete albums.</p>

<p>But how would it know what’s a complete album? Well, some simple logic and ID3 metadata is all we need. How do <em>you</em> know when you’re looking at a full album in iTunes or not? Probably when you look at the track numbers and see track 1, track 2, etc., in an unbroken order up through 6 or 8 or 10 or so. Also, you can list how many tracks an album has in the ID3 tag, so that instead of simply track “1”, the MP3 appears in iPod/iTunes as “1 of 9”. If the tracks are numbered like that and there’s something missing in the order up through “9 of 9”, then you know the album isn’t complete.</p>

<p>Sometimes, albums are only 1 or 2 long tracks. And perhaps the disc is an EP or a single and has only 3 or so tracks and a short running time.</p>

<p>With a little bit of programming logic, we can come up with a very simple algorithm that will match almost all complete albums, with few false positives (or false negatives). It’s not 100% bulletproof perfect, but it’s a WHOLE lot better than nothing at all.</p>

<p>The logic would go something like this (for non-programmers, the stuff to the right ofÂ  # signs are comments explaining the pseudocode, and not “code” itself):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>for each album:

   # Runs if album track numbers are listed as "1 of 9", "2 of 9", etc.
   if (tracks have metadata listing number of tracks - eg. the "y" in "1 of y"):
      if there exist tracks numbered 1 through y, with none missing:
         complete = true
      else:
         # Album is missing at least 1 track between "1" and "y"
         complete = false

<p>That’s it. Given a normal collection, which doesn’t have a ton of albums that are half-downloaded, this will yield almost perfect complete album matching.</p>

<p>With a little more thinking and research, we could refine this to further avoid false positives. I pulled the thresholds of 4 tracks and 25 minutes out of thin air. There may be more appropriate thresholds that result in more hits and fewer misses. But the point is that the general idea is sound, and that these numbers could be easily tweaked.</p>

<p>If someone allows a lot of half-downloaded albums to get into their collection, then the X &gt; 4 rule might hit a number of false positives. But the idea, at bare minimum, is to work well for well-formed MP3 collections. We could raise this total, but I didn’t want to exclude 5 and 6-track EPs. And of course, only half-downloaded albums that are tracks in order starting from 1, AND missing the track total metadata, would hit this rule.</p>

<p>Best of all, anyone who has issues with certain albums not matching could easily fix it by adding the “number of tracks” metadata to the albums that aren’t being matched. If it really is an 18 minute, 3 track album, all you’d have to do is edit it so the track numbers are “1 of 3”, “2 of 3”, etc. so that it would be matched against the first rule.</p>

<p>Now, an online-enabled music manager could compare tracks with its online database to confirm completeness. iTunes’ “Genius” already scans a complete collection and interacts with an online server - it would not be difficult to have it check albums against an online database and flag albums as “complete” or not in the iTunes database. But the above is a solution that would yield extremely good results for the vast majority of collections, and requires nothing but the information in ID3 tags and a small bit of programming logic.</p>

<p>I would love a “Complete Albums” browser view on my iPod. Or even just a “hide incomplete albums” option to toggle, to enable and disable this sort of filtering in the Genre, Artist, and Album browser views. That would be so fantastic.</p>

<p>Meet Chris Johnson, the talented (though not quite as much as he thinks) 2nd year running back for the Tennessee Titans. Like many athletes, Johnson has taken to Twitter to communicate with his fans. And like many athletes, Johnson has put on display that college “education” that only star collegiate athletes leave school with.</p>

<p>Early today, Johnson posted this description of an incident where he and a friend were pulled over for suspicion of drunk driving:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me and @<a href="http://twitter.com/kennyturner">kennyturner</a> is pulled over they think we drunk be we aint drink nothing my dawg ace the test walked the line touched hisnose theymad</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pro Football Talk posted a story about the tweet. Johnson didn’t like their characterization of the incident as a “near miss” for their infamous “Days Without An Arrest” counter. Johnson fired back:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@<a href="http://twitter.com/profootballtalk">profootballtalk</a> hey stop postinglies about me I didn’teven get close to goingto jail all I had was a red bull so let thepolice do their job</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A random Twitter user, RWJ19, posted a tweet to Johnson that read, “@<a href="http://twitter.com/ChrisJohnson28">ChrisJohnson28</a> They had a reason to pull you over. Therefor grow up. Don’t let all that money go to your head!”.</p>

<p>Johncon, with the kind of class that only Titan players ever achieve, could not let the comment go unanswered:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@<a href="http://twitter.com/RWJ19">RWJ19</a> u don’t let ur pocket change go to ur head</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Congratulations, Chris Johnson. You are the first entry in my Twitter Hall of Shame. You may ultimately be the only entry, as you alone made me think of the idea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While eating at Fresh Choice for lunch, an old lady handed me this:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/wpid-12476001735961.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>(OK, she was handing them out to everyone, not just targeting me)</p>

<p>I don’t know, old lady. When Jesus spoke of witnessing, I don’t think drive-by leafletting was what he had in mind.</p>

<p>And doesn’t the Good News (tm) deserve better quality printing, and paper that was cut out straight?</p>
