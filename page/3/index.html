  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mac OS X is a UNIX-based operating system. Apple proudly states that fact whenever they&rsquo;re pitching OS X.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/apple-unix.png"></p>

<p>A lot of people &ndash; myself included &ndash; like OS X in part because of this fact. I am primarily a Linux user, but for my personal laptop, it&rsquo;s nice to have a system with all the friendly-out-of-the-box UI trappings of a general consumer product, while still having UNIX at my fingertips.</p>

<p>As a UNIX system, though, Mac OS X has some limiting factors. One of the big ones is that the base system (the set of core tools that make up the OS, named Darwin on the Mac) is not really updatable. Updates come from Apple packaged as part of general operating system updates, but even when Apple does push out updates, it usually not all that up-to-date.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, the base system doesn&rsquo;t necessarily come with everything you might want. You can always compile from source, but this is 2011 and package management is a good thing.</p>

<p>There are three main community projects which bring package management for UNIX programs to Mac OS X. They are <a href="http://finkproject.org/">Fink</a>, <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>, and <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/"><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/homebrew.png"></a></p>

<p>Of these, my favorite is Homebrew. Homebrew is very light and lean, and ideal for people who just want to install some select packages to augment the Darwin base system.</p>

<p>Both Fink and MacPorts work around Darwin by existing in their own little ecosystems. When installing something that depends on another tool that already exists in Darwin, these package managers tend to install their own copies of those tools instead of using the one already on the system. There are some compatibility advantages to this, but at the same time, there is some confusion when there are multiple copies of libraries and binaries on the same system.</p>

<p>Homebrew takes the other approach, relying on what is provided in the Darwin base system instead of replicating everything itself. It augments Darwin instead of treating it as unreliable and building its own little world.</p>

<p>Homebrew in general &ldquo;feels&rdquo; nicer than Fink or MacPorts. In <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1096177">the words</a> of HackerNews commenter dschobel: &ldquo;There is so much less friction than using macports or fink that I dropped them immediately.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a good way of putting it. Homebrew is just less noisy and less intrusive.</p>

<p>There are other advantages to Homebrew. The scripts (or &ldquo;formula&rdquo; in Homebrew nomenclature) for building and installing packages are simple Ruby scripts. Combine the ease of creating formula with the ease of submitting them to the project &ndash; as it <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">lives on Github</a> and anyone can contribute with a simple fork and a pull request &ndash; and you&rsquo;ve got an environment for rapid crowdsourced updates.</p>

<p>And update it has. Originally I ran Homebrew with MacPorts as a backup for things that weren&rsquo;t yet in Homebrew, but the number of such packages has decreased dramatically. The 1587 formulas (as of this writing) in Homebrew is still much less than the 8100 packages in MacPorts or the 12000 packages in Fink, but the important stuff is well represented (and part of the difference is due to Homebrew intentionally excluding things already in Darwin). Still, it is perfectly fine to run more than one package manager to get the package coverage you need.</p>

<p>Homebrew is very easy to use &ndash; I won&rsquo;t bother replicating the explanation of basic commands here, as the <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">home page</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Installation">instructions on the wiki</a> cover them nicely. But I will share one little BASH alias that I use. There is no single Homebrew command for upgrading all of your installed Homebrew packages to their latest versions, the way you might in a Debian-based OS with an &ldquo;apt-get upgrade&rdquo;. But a handy little BASH alias takes care of that:</p>

<p>[bash]# Homebrew &ndash; upgrade all installed packages
alias brew-upgrade=&lsquo;brew update &amp;&amp; brew list | xargs brew install&rsquo;[/bash]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, I know they&rsquo;re the hipster&rsquo;s notebook and that they have a cultish following. Yes, I know that their posturing as the <a href="http://www.moleskine.com/moleskine_world/_the_legendary_notebook_moleskine.php">notebook of Hemingway and Picasso</a> is a healthy dose of creative license. Yes, I know that they&rsquo;re overpriced and that for all the talk of Italian design and French paper, they&rsquo;re <a href="http://www.moleskine.com/catalogue/moleskine_quality.php">bound together by cheap Chinese labor</a>.</p>

<p>But frankly, none of that speaks to the quality of the notebook. And as I nearly fill my first one with a year&rsquo;s worth of work notes, I must say that mine has been a durable, reliable tool.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/moleskine.jpg"> I&rsquo;ve never been completely happy with computer-based note-taking solutions (though I have come closer with Evernote on the iPad and iPhone). And like many geek brains &ndash; constantly preoccupied with the last technical problem it was trying to solve &ndash; mine is a forgetful one.</p>

<p>So, a year ago, I invested in my first Moleskine notebook. I had, of course, heard all of the praise from the true believers. I decided to give them a shot myself.</p>

<p>My writing needs are not like those of, say, actual <em>writers</em>. But I needed a good, compact notebook that I could take everywhere, and one that would be able to hold its own on the inside of a laptop bag, being smashed up against larger and heavier objects.</p>

<p>The Moleskine is beautifully and simply designed. The importance of the little strap that holds the book closed cannot be easily overstated. Unlike every other paper-based thing that is subjected to the interior of my laptop bag, the Moleskine pages stay intact and unmolested, locked away behind an impenetrable shell held closed by that handy little strap.</p>

<p>As much as I like the idea of going completely paperless (as I am with magazines and books), the &ldquo;best tool for the job&rdquo; mindset wins out. I will continue to use Evernote for certain things, but for my daily work notes, I will keep reaching for my Moleskine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a kid of around 9 or 10, I had a &ldquo;young adult&rdquo; focused football book. It was all about stories of players and games from football&rsquo;s past. It&rsquo;s almost the only football book I remember owning, and I literally read the covers off of it.</p>

<p>Having no idea who authored it or any sort of inkling of the book title, I tried to find the book. Armed only with a vague memory of what it looked like (yellowed pages, and some yellow on the cover somewhere) and a much less vague memory of the stories contained within, I headed over to Google Books to try and come up with some search queries to find the book in their archive of scanned books.</p>

<p>My first go-to queries related to the 222-0 Cumberland vs. Georgia Tech game. I knew very well that this story came from that book, but no joy. I searched for Dick &ldquo;Night Train&rdquo; Lane, but the hits there didn&rsquo;t yield my book either.</p>

<p>Finally, I struck gold. I remembered the story of Tony Dorsett and his 1,000 yard season streak (dating back to his high school days), and how the streak was broken by the 1982 player&rsquo;s strike. (In my memory, I thought it was the 1987 strike, but luckily, that didn&rsquo;t matter). I searched for: <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=tony+dorsett+strike&amp;btnG=Search&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbm=bks&amp;sa=2">Tony Dorsett 1,000 yards strike</a> and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5nNt_sPPMOMC&amp;q=tony+dorsett+strike&amp;dq=tony+dorsett+strike&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZhGmTdnmOIH2tgOB3t35DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw">found the exact page I was looking for</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dorsett.png"><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dorsett.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>It was only a snippet, but I vividly remember the phrasing of those sentences. I knew I had found what I had been trying in vain for the past few years to dig up in my memory.</p>

<p>The book was Sports Illustrated: Strange and Amazing Football Stories, written in 1986. And I&rsquo;ve come to figure out that I was incredibly lucky with that search phrase. Google Books does not have anywhere near the full text of the book archived, which is why neither Cumberland nor Night Train put me on the right track. Now that I knew the book&rsquo;s name and could pull it up on Google Books, I had a search bar that searched only this specific book. Most of the stories I remembered came up with no hits, and even ones that did came up with no scanned page snippets. The only hit I&rsquo;ve been able to come up with that gave me a look at the book was the Dorsett query.</p>

<p>But that was of no consequence any longer. Now I knew the book&rsquo;s name and author. Mystery solved; I had the bastard right where I wanted him. Next stop was Amazon, which gave me plenty of used copies to choose from. I picked out one listed in good condition, and a few days later:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/5614821296_f2c188c855_b.jpg"><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/5614821296_f2c188c855_b.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>Not being very long, the book was easy to breeze through in an evening. Reading through it confirmed every memory I had about it, and how many old football stories and tales of old players I knew came directly from this book:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cumberland losing to Georgia Tech in the most lopsided game ever, 222-0</li>
<li>The New York Giants spanking Sammy Baugh&rsquo;s Redskins 73-0 in the 1940 championship game</li>
<li>The <em>Heidi</em> game</li>
<li>The Stanford band game</li>
<li>Flutie&rsquo;s hail mary</li>
<li>Old players like Bronko Nagurski, Red Grange, Dick &ldquo;Night Train&rdquo; Lane</li>
<li>Jim Thorpe and the Oorang Indians (and lots of tales of early pro teams, which were more like traveling acts than a sports league)</li>
<li>Raymond Berry and his practice habits (including making his wife, Sally Berry, throw him passes to get more reps)</li>
<li>Chuck Bednarik as the last bastion of iron man football</li>
<li>Knute Rockne&rsquo;s Notre Dame all-stars versus the New York Giants</li>
<li>Abner Haynes&rsquo;s &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll kick to the clock&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>I could list plenty more. It&rsquo;s a nice collection of stories, especially given what the  book is. The author, Bill Gutman, apparently churned out these kinds of young reader sports books by the dozen, for publishers like Scholastic and, as in the case of this book, Archway (putting it alongside the likes of Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew books).</p>

<p>Sadly, fact-checking may have been a tad loose in this book, as I picked out one glaring factual error. At the end of telling the Jerry Kramer story, the author tied things up with a nice but oh-so-wrong sentence:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No wonder Jerry Kramer ended up in pro football&rsquo;s Hall of Fame&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

<p>Should I ever meet Kramer, I would ask him to sign this book, a relic from an alternate reality exactly like our own save for a Jerry Kramer bust in Canton.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve posted here! Believe it or not, I&rsquo;ve been writing a lot of blog posts. They&rsquo;re all saved as drafts, waiting for me to get around to doing all of the updates to this blog that I&rsquo;ve been meaning to.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve managed to import posts from my old Blogger blog back in college, and I am currently digging through the Wayback Machine to recover as many posts from my old LiveJournal &ndash; yes, LiveJournal &ndash; as possible. (If there&rsquo;s one thing I kick myself over, it&rsquo;s how insanely sloppy I was with data archival back in college. Actually, pretty much my entire life up until now. Turn 30 and now I want all that stuff back).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come up with a new simple design for the blog, updated to Wordpress 3.1.x, added Disqus commenting, syntax highlighting for whenever I post code snippets. And soon, to avoid repeating my past mistake, I&rsquo;m going to look into how to archive Twitter and Facebook content here.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been cooking up some technical posts and, of course, it&rsquo;s time to start talking football again, with the draft so close.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see if, this time, I can stick with maintaining my &ldquo;web presence&rdquo; here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are a couple of neat utilities in Mac OS X that a lot of advanced users / UNIX geeks love to use that I too have recently embraced.</p>

<p>The first is <a href="http://visor.binaryage.com/">Visor</a>. Visor is a terminal window that pulls down from the top of a Mac OS X system&rsquo;s screen when triggered by a hotkey. If you&rsquo;ve ever played a game like Quake and remember the drop-down console view triggered by hitting tilde (technically, backtick), then you know what this looks like. Instead of a game&rsquo;s console, however, it&rsquo;s a UNIX terminal (specifically, an instance of the OS X Terminal.app application).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Visor-300x187.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I prefer to use <a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/">iTerm</a> for my normal OS X terminal emulator, and unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no way to make Visor use iTerm instead of Terminal.app. But I find this to be of little concern. Visor is for running a quick UNIX command, something that doesn&rsquo;t demand I move off of my current desktop space to the one where I have iTerm/tmux running.</p>

<p>The other utility is <a href="http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>. Quicksilver is an application launcher. Instead of clicking icons in the Dock or browsing through the Applications folder in Finder, users can trigger Quicksilver with a keystroke, begin to type part of the application&rsquo;s name, then hit Enter to launch the app when Quicksilver has matched your typing to the specific app. In practice, users typically need to only type a few letters in the app&rsquo;s name for Quicksilver to properly figure out which one it is that the user is seeking.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/500x_quicksilver-300x253.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So, these things are great in OS X, but I hate having utilities like this on OS X and lacking them on Linux. Luckily, both of these tools are faithfully replicated by Linux software.</p>

<p>The counterpart to Quicksilver is <a href="http://do.davebsd.com/">GNOME Do</a>, which is quite frankly almost a note-for-note re-creation of Quicksilver in Mono. I have no hang-ups on using Mono software, and I greatly prefer following the Quicksilver look and behavior as closely as possible, so this works great for me.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/gnomedo_interface.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A Visor replacement was harder to find. I tried <a href="http://tilda.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Tilda</a> but just opening and closing it was very error prone. Twitter user <a href="http://twitter.com/mrf">@mrf</a> clued me in to <a href="http://www.guake.org">Guake</a>, which works nearly as well as Visor. I also like how Guake is transparently named after its gaming inspiration.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/guake-shot-300x223.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>My hotkeys for these apps are control-backtick for Quicksilver/GNOME Do, and alt-backtick (or command-backtick) for Visor/Guake.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it took me so long to come around on these tools. I&rsquo;ve known about Quicksilver and Visor for some time. I suppose it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve become more of a keyboard-dominant UNIX user, and these tools provide some nice functionality for making use of the keyboard within a GUI environment. Particularly in OS X, I&rsquo;m making far less use of the Dock as an application launcher.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I spent a lot of time fussing with bootable USB thumbsticks, trying to set one up that would boot the new backup server I just built at work. The machine has no optical drive, so I just wanted to boot a simple netinstall and have the system pull everything it needs from remote mirrors.</p>

<p>The supposed easy method was to use <a href="http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/">Unetbootin</a>. Everything about it <em>was</em> easy, except for the part where the bootable USB sticks it created didn&rsquo;t work. Every boot attempt was met with &ldquo;Boot error&rdquo; or &ldquo;Missing operating system&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Since I am on Ubuntu, I tried to use Ubuntu&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Live_USB_creator">usb-creator</a>. Also a nice app, except for the fact that it too failed to work. In usb-creator&rsquo;s case, the failure was to even get started. I would browse to the ISO that I wanted to use as the image for my boot stick, and the app refused to load it, or any ISO. No error, the app simply didn&rsquo;t respond to the input.</p>

<p>So, two piece-a-junk GUI apps down. After a little digging, I found the methods that created working USB sticks on the first try.</p>

<h3>For CentOS:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download diskboot.img from a CentOS mirror&rsquo;s centos/(version)/os/(arch)/images folder.
(I used the kernel.org mirror and i386 arch, so my diskboot.img was located at: <a href="http://mirrors.kernel.org/centos/5.5/os/i386/images/">http://mirrors.kernel.org/centos/5.5/os/i386/images/</a>)</li>
<li>Insert USB stick (I&rsquo;ll assume it&rsquo;s /dev/sdb, adjust instructions to fit your system), format to FAT32 (I used Gparted for this)</li>
<li>Run:
<code>
 dd if=diskboot.img of=/dev/sdb
</code></li>
<li>Remove USB drive, stick into machine that&rsquo;s getting the CentOS install, and boot
When asked for installation media, select HTTP. Use the website and folder path of the mirror you&rsquo;re using.<br>
So, from my example:<br>
<strong>Website name:</strong> mirrors.kernel.org<br>
<strong>CentOS directory:</strong> centos/5.5/os/i386<br></li>
</ol>


<p>Proceed through installer as normal.</p>

<h3>For Debian:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download boot.img.gz from /debian/dists/(version)/main/(installer-arch)/current/images/hd-media folder<br>
(I did i386 stable from Debian&rsquo;s US mirror, so boot.img.gz was located at:<br>
<a href="http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/installer-i386/current/images/hd-media/">http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/installer-i386/current/images/hd-media/</a>)</li>
<li>Download Debian netinstall ISO (I used: <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/5.0.5/i386/iso-cd/debian-505-i386-netinst.iso">http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/5.0.5/i386/iso-cd/debian-505-i386-netinst.iso</a>)</li>
<li>Insert USB drive (again I&rsquo;ll assume /dev/sdb) and format to FAT32</li>
<li>Run:
<code>
 zcat boot.img.gz &gt; /dev/sdb
</code></li>
<li>Remove and re-insert USB drive. Copy the netinstall ISO to the USB drive.</li>
<li>Stick USB into machine getting the Debian install, boot, and run through installer.</li>
</ol>


<p>I imagine these instructions will probably stay good for a long time. You&rsquo;ll just need to adjust for mirror location, arch and release numbers, but the URLs I&rsquo;ve provided here should give you a good clue as to where to find the necessary files on the mirror you&rsquo;re using.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/brightkite.jpg"></p>

<p>Brightkite is one of those location-based social net services, the ones where you &ldquo;check in&rdquo; at places and see where other people check in. It&rsquo;s like Gowalla and Foursquare, except (IMO) not quite as good.</p>

<p>The one compelling feature of Brightkite, however, is group SMS. It allows users to create an SMS &ldquo;party line&rdquo;, which works with any SMS-capable phone. Chatters don&rsquo;t even have to be part of the service &ndash; they can simply be invited by phone number.</p>

<p>This, however, creates weird Brightkite &ldquo;garbage&rdquo; accounts (my term), which creates issues when that phone number goes and becomes a full-blown Brightkite member. In my family&rsquo;s little group text, for example, there&rsquo;s one of these garbage accounts which corresponds to a phone number that is now a number associated with a real Brightkite account. But other than polluting our chat&rsquo;s user list, this is mostly harmless.</p>

<p>Less harmless is the fact that the friends list appears <em>completely</em> broken. My wife and I, for example, just sat next to each other, on our respective MacBooks, typing in each other&rsquo;s username and real names, trying to pull up each other&rsquo;s profile so that we can friend each other.</p>

<p>Every search, zero hits.</p>

<p>We were finally able to figure out that we could see each other&rsquo;s profile by clicking on each other&rsquo;s name in the group chat userlist. However, when we attempted to friend each other, the service said that we&rsquo;re already friends.</p>

<p>Yet, when we look at our own friends list, neither of us appear on the other&rsquo;s friend list.</p>

<p>This is just the latest way in which Brightkite has shown itself to me to be a bit of a wreck. Unfortunately, I have found no other service that gives us the ability to do this sort of group SMS that works with any SMS user (we&rsquo;ve found things that work with all iPhones, for example, but my parents aren&rsquo;t on iPhones yet. If anyone knows of other services that do this, please let me know).</p>
