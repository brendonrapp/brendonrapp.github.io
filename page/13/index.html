  <div class="entry-content"><p>Something new I have decided to do with this page is to post things I read online that I find to be insightful, or at least a concise bit of knowledge or opinion found in my travels through the internet ether. Some of them may be obvious to some people, but others may find something of interest in them.
This comes from Jun-Dai from the Criterion forums, on the topic of high-definition video disc (Blu-Ray, HD-DVD) adoption:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>I&rsquo;ll eat my hat if DVD isn&rsquo;t the highest quality home video format in the US with more than 10% adoption for the next five years at least. The format war isn&rsquo;t the biggest of the obstacles, but it&rsquo;s definitely an obstacle. People simply aren&rsquo;t ready for another format, and more importantly, the higher quality formats offer nothing over DVD other than quality, whereas DVD offered a good deal over the previous formats (in order of importance: small form factor, no degradation, improved video quality, easy access to favorite scenes/no rewinding, all DVD players play CDs, and special features).</em></p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;So <em>Legion</em>&rdquo;, you say, &ldquo;tell me something about games!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Happy to.</p>

<p>First off, if you don&rsquo;t own an <strong>Xbox 360</strong>, please remedy that fact now (Ryan! Greg!). The 360 has quickly pushed its way to the center of my gaming world. The number of games both out and coming out for it make it irresistible, especially for online play.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter (Xbox 360):</strong> I played through the single player campaign when it came out. It was pretty good. But I&rsquo;ve recently starting playing it online again. It&rsquo;s pretty sharp, and runs great online (unlike the last Clancy shooter I tried online, Rainbow Six 3).</p>

<p><strong>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (Xbox 360):</strong> I&rsquo;m an Elder Scrolls fan back from Daggerfall, and though Morrowind didn&rsquo;t quite work out for me, this game has. It&rsquo;s a joy just to ride a horse through the lush, green world. I had a problem with this game when I first got it. I didn&rsquo;t like the fact that enemies level up in accordance to your level. I felt like there was no advancing in the game. I even asked, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo;. Eventually, it hit me &ndash; like a non-RPG, the point is to go from one place to another and experience the content. It&rsquo;s funny how we can get hung up on existing conventions and expectations. This is one game worth full price.</p>

<p><strong>Rainbow Six: Vegas (Xbox 360):</strong> This will be my next online shooter. The videos I&rsquo;ve watched look fantastic, and the single-player demo is fun. I hope they&rsquo;ve gotten past the lag issues of the last Rainbow Six I played online.</p>

<p><strong>Gears of War (Xbox 360):</strong> What I&rsquo;ve heard from interviews on podcasts is that this is going to have some great online gameplay twists, but the meat of the game is an awesome sci-fi single player shooter experience. I&rsquo;m dying to play this one.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.everybody-dies.com/screenshots/screenshot3.jpg"><img src="http://www.everybody-dies.com/screenshots/t_screenshot3.jpg" alt="" /></a><strong>Defcon (PC):</strong> Nuclear war is probably one of my favorite topics for entertainment. Defcon scratches that itch. It&rsquo;s a game that &ldquo;simulates&rdquo; nuclear war, played out entirely on a &ldquo;command room&rdquo; world map screen, like something from WarGames. You don&rsquo;t see any realistic graphics, just little insignias representing cities, missile silos, ships, submarines, and everything else needed to wage nuclear war. The premise is simple &ndash; nuke your opponents&#8217; populations to hell while trying to keep as many of yours alive as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Splinter Cell: Double Agent (Xbox 360): </strong>This was the most disappointing single player Splinter Cell ever. It was still good, but not <strong>great</strong> like Chaos Theory. The multiplayer, however, is a new streamlined version of the Splinter Cell &ldquo;spies vs. mercenaries&rdquo; multiplayer that&rsquo;s been part of the series since Pandora Tomorrow. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to get into, but I&rsquo;m not sure how much lasting power it will have.</p>

<p><strong>Club House Games (Nintendo DS):</strong> Do you have a DS? Get this game! It&rsquo;s shockingly good.  It&rsquo;s 42 little card, board, and other touch screen games. Does a game with little versions of poker, blackjack, bowling, chess, backgammon, darts, and some unique mini games like &ldquo;word balloon&rdquo; sound fun? It doesn&rsquo;t? Well, it really is. None of the games are meaty enough to be worth attention by themselves. But a game that sends you jumping from one little game to the next, it actually is the perfect &ldquo;pick up and go&rdquo; DS game. Did I mention it has online play and single-cart local wireless? It&rsquo;s the ultimate DS time killer.</p>

<p><strong>DOOM (Xbox 360):</strong> The original DOOM was released on Xbox Live Arcade. I can&rsquo;t believe how much I&rsquo;ve played that damn game. I&rsquo;ll play multiplayer with anyone else that has it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Lose</strong> is what you do when you&rsquo;re not winning.</p>

<p><strong>Loose</strong> is what something is when it&rsquo;s not tight.</p>

<p>Losing is the process of not winning. Loosing is not a damn word at all.
I&rsquo;d had quite enough of people getting this wrong. It&rsquo;s bad enough on message boards. What has pushed me over the edge now is the fact that the game Splinter Cell: Double Agent incorrectly has &ldquo;loosing&rdquo; in place of EVERY instance of the word &ldquo;losing&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not just a lone typo. It&rsquo;s a localization team that couldn&rsquo;t pass 2nd grade spelling.</p>

<p>If you are reading this, and I&rsquo;m sure very few people are&hellip; please do not get this wrong again. Ever. Please.</p>

<p>Because of her, I can not watch Studio 60 or Entourage when they&rsquo;ve been freshly taped &ndash; I must wait for her to come over and watch too.</p>

<p>Every Monday Night, we go out to a pizza place and watch football. She now watches some on Sunday on her own as well &ndash; not a fanatic yet but her football viewing and knowledge increases each season.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.mobiletracker.net/archives/images/palm-treo-650-thumb.jpg" alt="" /> After my last piece of junk cell phone broke (the <a href="http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details.jsp?globalObjectId=55">Motorola V180</a>), I decided to get out of the &ldquo;buying whatever phone Cingular offers cheapest&rdquo; rat race and buy myself a cell phone worthy of owning.</p>

<p>That phone is the Palm Treo 650. I bought a slightly used (but in fantastic shape) Treo off of eBay.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://www.chatteremail.com/">Chatter Email</a>, my email gets &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; to my cell phone, Blackberry style.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://www.pdaapps.com/verichat/">VeriChat</a>, I have a multi-network IM client right on my phone. Even when my phone is asleep with the screen off, I&rsquo;m still logged into AIM and ICQ in the background, and when someone messages me, my phone wakes and alerts me.</p>

<p>With the included Blazer web browser, I&rsquo;ve got an awfully nice bite-sized web browser. I&rsquo;ve bookmarked a number of PDA-friendly websites (ESPN&rsquo;s &ldquo;PocketPC&rdquo; version of their site, Amazon Anywhere, AOL Moviefone WAP, and others).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great. Cingular offers unlimited Internet access for $20, and it&rsquo;s excellent. It&rsquo;s not a 3G phone so I can&rsquo;t get on those super-fast data networks like Verizon&rsquo;s EVDO, but my next smartphone will. As it is, going from regular junky phone to any kind of usable Internet access at all is quite a jump, and Cingular&rsquo;s EDGE network is just fine for email, IM, and some on-the-spot web browsing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love a higher quality camera (it only has a VGA, 0.3 megapixel camera), and faster data support, and maybe a better web browser (Blazer is nice but slow, other browsers on the Palm are either fast and ugly or fast and crashy-unstable). I know I will upgrade a year or so from now and look back and wonder how I lived with some of the &ldquo;lacking&rdquo; features. But right now, I&rsquo;m giddy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this week, EA released Madden 07 for the Xbox, PS2, Xbox 360, and a bunch of other platforms.</p>

<p>I initially picked up the Xbox 360 version, only to end up replacing it with the plain ol&#8217; Xbox version.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the difference? Well, they&rsquo;re basically different games. The 360 version is very disappointing, while the Xbox version (while not as pretty) plays much better.</p>

<p>The flaws with the 360 game are numerous. First, the game has a terrible default camera angle, which is way too low and makes it unnecessarily difficult to seeÂ  the sidelines or downfield (and judge distances). Next, the control is highly inferior to the Xbox game. You have much more precise control over your players on the Xbox. MUCH more precise. Furthermore, passing control is shoddy on the 360, lacking the exact pass placement ability of the Xbox. Some minor bugs and glitches on the 360 version add a thin layer of crap to the foundation that just doesn&rsquo;t hold up to scrutiny when compared to the other version of the game bearing the same name.</p>

<p>If you want to play Madden, get it for the Xbox or PS2. It&rsquo;s not just the better version, but it&rsquo;s a GREAT football game &ndash; the first one since NFL2K5. It lacks the more &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; graphics and the presentation isn&rsquo;t as shiny, but it&rsquo;s such a great game to play. Best Madden since the Super NES.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I seem to have trouble finding good websites that review electronic music. Most that I find are hopelessly light on content, or focus on a very tiny sliver of the electronic music whole, lacking sufficient perspective. A lot of electronic music reviews I find are afterthoughts buried on sites more compeletely devoted to indie rock.
I do go to <a href="http://igloomag.com/">Igloo Magazine</a> sometimes, but it&rsquo;s not quite what I want.</p>

<p>Anyone know of better places to look?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/media/images/loughlin.jpg" alt="" />What happens when your late night TV viewing consists of Full House and a PBS show on string theory?</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/media/images/morgan-webb.jpg" alt="" />You get a dream about Full House characters getting stuck in an alternate reality (which happens to be evil) using their wits and powers of persuasion to avoid 24 hour lockdown by the evil Full House character counterparts. They then prepare a daring last-second escape and destruction of the evil world (which involved tossing some kind of powder from the non-evil world into a shallow pool of water, and submerging themselves in the water), and pull it off with the aid of a monkey from the evil world that wasn&rsquo;t evil (because monkeys are always good).</p>

<p>This is what my head concocts when left to its own devices.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not so bad, though. The night before last, the dream involved me and a half-naked Morgan Webb hanging in a hotel. If I can figure out the late-night TV combination that creates that, I&rsquo;ll patent it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/splintercell.jpg" alt="Splinter Cell (GameCube)" />A night ago, I had a dream. I dreamt that I was at a GameStop store with Stacey (my fiancee, for any new readers&hellip; &ldquo;new readers&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s funny). I was scoping out the Nintendo DS games, while Stacey was browsing around the GameCube stuff. I didn&rsquo;t find anything very interesting, so I walked over to Stacey. I asked her if she found anything. She turned to me, holding a copy of Splinter Cell for the GameCube. She said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve played all the cute games on the GameCube,  I think I&rsquo;ll try something else and branch out.&rdquo; Everyone at the store was impressed, and I was so proud. We embraced, and kissed, and the camera zoomed out for our cinematic romantic moment.</p>

<p>Today, I told Stacey about the dream.</p>

<p>She ain&rsquo;t buying Splinter Cell. :(</p>
