  <div class="entry-content"><p>The new &ldquo;Battlestar Galactica&rdquo; series on SciFi Channel is easily the most surprising newer TV show I&rsquo;ve seen. Given the franchise&rsquo;s pedigree (the original cheesy &lsquo;70s Star Wars ripoff TV show), I didn&rsquo;t expect to be watching this show. But given the amount of hype in non-scifi media leading up to the new show&rsquo;s debut, I decided to watch the 2003 mini-series that led to this show. What I found was something pretty good. So, I added the new show to the TiVO Season Pass, and it has not disappointed.</p>

<p>To me, quality sci-fi shows and movies are the ones that succeed in being believable, given their premise. &ldquo;Sliders&rdquo; is an example of this. The sci-fi of the original seasons was the premise that the characters could move between realities. The result was a show that was more of a historical game of &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; rather than a sci-fi show: the first two seasons were mostly about what Earth would be like if certain events had never happened, or happened differently (like, if the American colonies hadn&rsquo;t broken away from the British empire). If we can accept the sci-fi premise of the show, everything that resulted from it were things that were conceivable.</p>

<p>Then there are the other kind of sci-fi shows: the ones that use the fact that they are sci-fi as the basis to do anything they wish, no matter how inane. These shows essentially use pseudo-technobabble as a way of justifying what is essentially no better than voodoo magic. They use &ldquo;scifi&rdquo; as a blank check to do any stupid thing they wish. An awful lot of scifi shows do this. To go back to &ldquo;Sliders&rdquo;, as that show progressed into its later seasons, it became obvious that the ideas were tapped out. So, a lot of extra junk was introduced to the show, and explained away with various half-hearted scifi explanations.</p>

<p>Battlestar, so far, mostly falls into the former camp. The show is based on the idea of space travel and AI that turns against its creators. Accept those ideas, and the rest of the show (so far) is reasonably believable. They haven&rsquo;t tried to introduce any &ldquo;magic&rdquo; dressed up as sci-fi or anything. I mean, there is always an element of suspended disbelief. But, to me, the mark of a good sci-fi show is one that doesn&rsquo;t require you to throw good sense out the window and accept any more ridiculous sci-fi &ldquo;magic&rdquo; than is absolutely necessary.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m currently about 15 hours into Knights of the Old Republic II. Today at work, I was listening to <a href="http://radio.yankidank.com/">Yankidank&rsquo;s Gamer&rsquo;s Radio podcast</a>, and he went on  about how much recycling of content Knights II uses. Not only is the core gameplay essentially the same, with only very minor additions, but a lot of the settings are right out of the original game (though more deserted and run-down since the first game).</p>

<p>I have to admit that the game has been fun to play. I almost feel guilty, given how much repackaging the game uses (at least up to the point I&rsquo;m at). There&rsquo;s also a character from the original game that appears in cutscenes in the new game, and I&rsquo;m guessing there will probably be an encounter with the character at a later stage in the game.</p>

<p>Even if it is a major cash-in for Obsidian (they didn&rsquo;t even make the first game, but they sure had no problem using as much of Bioware&rsquo;s work as possible), if it&rsquo;s fun, does it matter?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a Jaguars fan, I am somewhat split on the decision of the Jacksonville Jaguars to <a href="http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/020905/jag_17921968.shtml">rebuff the Vikings advances for a possible trade for Randy Moss</a>. On the one hand, Moss is a game-changer. Jimmy Smith and Randy Moss would make the best receiving combo in the game. On the other hand, Moss brings baggage, and it&rsquo;s far too early to give up on the two Jags rookie receivers: Reggie Williams and Ernest Wilford. Both showed promise this season. But again, the idea of having one of those guys develop into a #3 to play alongside Jimmy and Randy is awfully enticing. Plus, Jimmy has only a couple seasons left, and if both rookies develop, it could be a Moss/Williams/Wilford trio for a few years.</p>

<p>The interesting part is that owner Wayne Weaver&rsquo;s replies to the advances had nothing to do with Moss&rsquo;s on-and-off-field problems. Instead, all he commented on is that the asking price (two 1st-rounders or a 1st rounder + starter) is too high. That is an awful lot to give up, but when about half of 1st-round picks fall short of expectations, one has to wonder if Moss would quite possibly outperform two 1st-round picks.</p>

<p>Unlike Minnesota, Jacksonville has a hell of a defense, and Moss would be one mighty spark for a young offense. I would be more excited than worried if the team did roll the dice and take the risk. But if they&rsquo;re not going to, then they better hit home runs with those 1st round picks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have replaced my old homepage with <a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com">a new Wordpress-powered journal</a>, with snazzy new features to come. Finally time to replace my old static page.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, Wordpress allows me to mirror my journal posts there on my <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/avantlegion/">LiveJournal</a> and my <a href="http://www.xanga.com/private/home.aspx?user=legioncsuf">Xanga journal</a>. So if you read my posts on either of those journals (the Xanga one has been just a placeholder until now, really), my wonderful musings and other crap will continue to appear there too.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty nice, with a lot of plugin features for me to explore. But I can still take advantage of the Livejournal and Xanga communities (a feature of questionable value sometimes, but regardless&hellip;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am not one that is against cell phone use in cars. I am, however, against stupid people.</p>

<p>Something  I see occasionally is someone driving in the car with a cell phone to  their ear, and their head tilted in towards the phone.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>And  I&rsquo;m not talking about using your head to hold the phone against your  shoulder. I&rsquo;ve done that before, although not with cell phones. No, I&rsquo;m  talking about holding the phone with your hand, and still tilting your  head, as much as a full 45 degrees (!!) &ldquo;into&rdquo; the phone.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

<p>Why???</p>

<p>OK,  of the two things here, one of them is firmly attached to something  (and that would be your head attached to your neck). The phone is free  to be moved around in space. HOLD THE PHONE UP TO YOUR EAR, YOU  RIDICULOUS MORON! What, is your Nokia too heavy to lift up past your  shoulder? Arms too short to reach far enough to hold it up to your head?</p>

<p>And that is all for today&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stupid Human Behavior&rdquo;.</p>
