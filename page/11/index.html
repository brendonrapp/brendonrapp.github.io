  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/hot_dips_module.jpg"><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/hot_dips_module.jpg" alt="Hot Dips" /></a>Dairy Queen&rsquo;s latest advertising features their &ldquo;Hot Dips&rdquo; product, which is basically a rebranding of their existing chicken strip basket, except that they nuke the BBQ sauce to make it hot. Oh, and they knocked the price of the 4-piece meal down to $4.99, which is a pretty sweet deal for a box of fries, chicken, and Texas toast.</p>

<p>More importantly, as a connoisseur of fast-food chicken strips, I must say that the Dairy Queen ones rank very highly. Here&rsquo;s my ranking breakdown of the fast-food chicken strips I&rsquo;ve had:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sonic Drive-In (best around, too bad there&rsquo;s no Sonic anywhere in Monterey County!)</li>
<li>Dairy Queen
(then a big drop off until the next group)</li>
<li>Carl&rsquo;s Jr. (as long as they are cooked to a crisp, some places undercook them &ndash; not salmonella undercook, just not cooked to a crisp and as such, not that good)</li>
<li>Burger King (chicken tenders and chicken fries, nice and reliable)</li>
<li>Arby&rsquo;s (decent)</li>
<li>McDonald&rsquo;s (I don&rsquo;t have them much because McD&rsquo;s fries are lethal even by fast food standards)</li>
<li>KFC (too greasy, ack!)</li>
<li>Foster&rsquo;s Freeze</li>
<li>Jack &lsquo;n the Box (they used to be <em>fantastic</em>, not anymore)
Unranked: Wendy&rsquo;s (crap! crap! crap!)</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s all I can remember off the top of my head.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The following is a quick peek into my football related bookmarks&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://jaguars.com/News/AskVic.aspx">Ask Vic column</a> at Jaguars.com &ndash; It&rsquo;s rare to find candid commentary on an official team website, but Ask Vic is exactly that. The idea is brilliant: an old curmudgeon football guy writing an online column in a wired age far removed from his old-school roots. Although ostensibly a Jaguars Q&amp;A column, the focus of the articles tends to drift away from the Jaguars and spend a lot of time on general NFL topics. Common themes include the &lsquo;70s Steelers, running and stopping the run, intricacies of the salary cap era, building through the draft, Vic&rsquo;s disdain of newfangled things like video games and fantasy football, lots of old players that today&rsquo;s young fans have never heard of, quality of the hot dogs in various teams&rsquo; press booths, and many more. I don&rsquo;t doubt that Vic hams up the cranky old pigskin writer role a bit for effect, but there&rsquo;s an undeniable character there that makes it a favorite of NFL fans, not just Jaguar fans.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.profootballtalk.com/rumormill.htm">ProFootballTalk.com&rsquo;s Rumor Mill</a> &ndash; This has been a very interesting site to watch over the past few years. It has become a forum for leaked stories from league insiders, the kind of stuff that rarely ends up in an official press release. Although some stories end up being firmly the stuff of rumor, a lot of real stories end up breaking here <em>long</em> before the &ldquo;real media&rdquo; gets on them. The Vick dogfighting story, for example, was tracked there for weeks before anyone else started even whispering about it. The real value, though, are the NFL insider rumblings that never turn into substantiated reports. Despite the &ldquo;dirty laundry&rdquo; type of content that is often a staple of the blog, the site manages to maintain a light tone thanks to a self-deprecating quality. The reports aren&rsquo;t always correct, but they&rsquo;re right more often than they should be, and they&rsquo;re always a good read either way.</p>

<p><a href="http://ffmastermind.com/quickbits.php">FFMastermind&rsquo;s NFL Quick Bits</a> &ndash; FFMastermind has been around since 1996, and frankly the site looks almost the same <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981205090957/www.ffmastermind.com/bits/hot.shtml">as it did back then</a>. FFMastermind.com offers a lot of premium fantasy football content, but the wonderful NFL Quick Bits page is free and has been a staple of my bookmarks for over a decade now. Despite the complete lack of technical progress (it&rsquo;s just a big fat heap of static content, no RSS feed to be found), it&rsquo;s still the best collection of one-stop NFL news around. All of the stories that appear in a team&rsquo;s local press clippings end up collected on this page. It makes it easy to keep up on the kind of news that local beat writers dig up, without having to actually follow 32 different local newspapers&#8217; sports sections. Did you know who Marques Colston was <em>before</em> last season started, and were you aware he was the team&rsquo;s starting WR2? I was, and it was thanks to the reports that local Saints writers wrote, which ended up being quoted on NFL Quick Bits.</p>

<p><a href="http://footballoutsiders.com/">Football Outsiders</a> is really a gem. In an Internet era of everyone echoing everyone else&rsquo;s content and calling it &ldquo;news&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s rare to see a site doing the kind of unique, original content that Football Outsiders does. From their &ldquo;Play of the Day&rdquo; breakdown of specific NFL plays (the kind of actual X&rsquo;s and O&rsquo;s breakdown that is nearly impossible to find online), to their <em>deep</em> statistical analyses (some of which may be of questionable value, but all of which are highly interesting), to some slightly more traditional NFL and fantasy football breakdowns, Football Outsiders is just brilliant. It&rsquo;s the kind of in-depth football content that nobody else is out there providing. These guys also put out the annual Pro Football Prospectus publication, which I ordered for the first time this year. I can&rsquo;t wait to get my hands on it.</p>

<p><a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/writers/dr_z/archive/index.html">Dr. Z&rsquo;s NFL Mailbag</a> &ndash;  A lot of NFL writers are total hacks. Paul Zimmerman, however, is one of the truly knowledgeable ones. His NFL Mailbag is somewhat similar to Ask Vic, if a bit overly wordy. Pretty much all of Dr. Z&rsquo;s columns take 3 pages to say what should fit into 1, but the content that is there is usually worth the digging.</p>

<p><a href="http://nfl.com/writers/kirwan">Pat Kirwan at NFL.com</a> &ndash; Another NFL writer worth reading. Kirwan is excellent on SIRIUS NFL Radio,  and he&rsquo;s great on NFL.com as well. His coaching &amp; front office background shines through in his league knowledge, and he provides a nice perspective on current situations that goes above just re-telling the daily league news.</p>

<p><a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/writers/peter_king/archive/index.html">Peter King&rsquo;s Monday Morning Quarterback</a> &ndash; This column doesn&rsquo;t get archived into its own page, so the link goes to King&rsquo;s entire SI.com archive. Thankfully, King has some good stories outside of MMQ, but be sure to check out MMQ every Monday.</p>

<p><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/keyword/search?searchString=Gregg_Easterbrook">Gregg Easterbrook&rsquo;s Tuesday Morning Quarterback</a> &ndash; ESPN.com fares no better than SI.com in organizing content, so here too is a link to an archive of all Gregg Easterbrook writings at ESPN.com. It works out better here, though, as TMQ is basically all Easterbrook does. :) TMQ is a more humorous take on the week in football, sneaking in a bit of insight wrapped in all that irreverent chatter.</p>

<p>No direct link for this one since it&rsquo;s part of a premium service, but the training camp reports at <a href="http://www.footballinjuries.com">FootballInjuries.com</a> are my top source of information during July and August.  They are wonderful, &ldquo;boots on the ground&rdquo; detailed reports of what is going on at all 32 NFL training camps. During the season, the service is also the best source of injury information, letting you know exactly how much a particular player participated (or didn&rsquo;t participate) in each practice session of the week. A great deal of the site&rsquo;s content is fantasy related, and although I&rsquo;m not a big fan of their player rankings (partner site <a href="http://www.fantasyguru.com">FantasyGuru.com</a> is much better in this regard, IMO), I do find great value in their ADP (Average Draft Position) reports, incorporating that information into my personal fantasy draft sheets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nfldraftcountdown.com/">NFL Draft Countdown</a> &ndash;  From February through April, this is the place to be. Best draft info you can get without paying out the nose for a premium service.</p>

<p>Finally, this site isn&rsquo;t for reading, but <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/">pro-football-reference.com</a> is an excellent one-stop source of stats, standings, Pro Bowl rosters, etc, going as far back as 1920. Defensive stats, sadly, only go back to 2002, which may be a function of the puzzling approach the NFL takes toward defensive stats (sacks weren&rsquo;t an official stat until 1982, and tackles are still not an official stat). Outside of that, this is a fantastic reference site, and something I constantly refer to.</p>

<p>Anything I missed?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OUT NOW:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/112047-1.jpg"><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/112047-1.jpg" alt="Calling All Cars" /></a>I now have a PS3, so I am working though a (very thin) back catalogue of good PS3 games (that aren&rsquo;t on the 360 or PC). The first game to really catch my attention is a simple downloadable game, <strong>Calling All Cars</strong>. It has earned more attention than most PlayStation Network download games because of the fact that it was developed by God of War creative head David Jaffe. It&rsquo;s quite a departure from his work on the epic scale that God of War was. It reminds me of the multiplayer portions of the Midtown Madness games, except shrunk down to an RC Pro-Am style &frac34; overhead view. The gameplay is simple: drive your car into the escaping convict to make him fly up in the air and land in your car, and drive him to the jail. If any other player rams into your car, the convict will fly out of your car and into theirs. You, then, try to ram them and get the convict back. Whomever takes him to jail gets the points, and he immediately &ldquo;escapes&rdquo; again and the chase is on anew. It&rsquo;s frantic, manic fun, though it doesn&rsquo;t have a whole lot of content or variety. Great for online play with friends.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/4655-001.jpg"><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/4655-001.jpg" alt="Tomb Raider: Anniversary" /></a>If you&rsquo;re still slumming on a PS2, or (better yet) have a decent PC with GameTap, please check out <strong>Tomb Raider: Anniversary. </strong>It is, bare none, the best Tomb Raider game ever. Last year&rsquo;s Tomb Raider: Legend was a major rebound for the languishing franchise (moving the property to developer Crystal Dynamics is the best thing that could have happened to it), but it still was a bit more action-heavy and featured some pointless motorcycle stages. This game is a remake of the original 1996 game, using the snazzy engine from TR: Legend, bringing the great original spelunking adventure up to today&rsquo;s 3D adventure standards (the original game was quite frustrating with its primitive 3D nature &ndash; trying to hit a ledge just right for a jump was a hair-pulling affair). Nintendo Wii owners will have this game soon, and 360 owners will be able to download it episodically from Xbox Live Marketplace. But with such a lean summer and such a bountiful fall of games, I suggest plugging a 360 controller into your PC and playing this off GameTap. It&rsquo;s beautiful, and runs exquisitely well on middle-of-the-road hardware.</p>

<p>COMING SOON:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/115628-1.jpg"><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/115628-1.jpg" alt="All-Pro Football 2K8" /></a>2K football is back. <strong>All-Pro Football 2K8</strong> moves on without the NFL license, opting instead to license over 240 former NFL players (ranging from legends like Joe Montana to merely &ldquo;decent&rdquo; players like Yancey Thigpen). Players will create their own teams, choosing 11 &ldquo;legend&rdquo; players broken up between gold, silver, and bronze tiers, and then the rest of the team&rsquo;s lineup is filled by randomly generated players. The videos look excellent, displaying a bit of a lack of player model detail, but an impressive range of realistic animations. Customization and personalized touches are the name of the game here, as players will create their fictional teams by choosing one of over 150 team names and city names, as well as designing a helmet logo. I, for one, am excited to create professional football franchises for Fresno and Salinas. Online leagues are back, which is something NFL 2K5 excelled at and Madden has still completely failed to deliver. 2K8 releases July 16th. (Note to 360 &amp; PS3 owners: all of this year&rsquo;s football games have been confirmed to <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3160709">run significantly better on the Xbox 360</a>, so if Xbox Live wasn&rsquo;t enough to make the decision obvious, you should keep this in mind and probably stick with the 360 game).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/ncaafootball08_xbox360boxboxart_160w.jpg"><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/ncaafootball08_xbox360boxboxart_160w.jpg" alt="NCAA Football 08" /></a>Also making a big splash this month is <strong>NCAA Football 08</strong>. I never thought I&rsquo;d live to see a WAC player on the cover of NCAA Football, but there&rsquo;s Jared Zabransky, QB of last year&rsquo;s undefeated, Fiesta Bowl winning Boise State Broncos. EA&rsquo;s football games on the next generation consoles have been, in a word, disasters. Rubbish. Completely inferior to the mature versions running on the old consoles (and on the PC and Wii, which have not yet been migrated to the new next-gen code base, and been better off for it). That may be changing, however, if this <a href="http://www.maddenmatrix.com/ncaa08/ea_commday_mad_report.pdf">hands-on report</a> from the first ever EA NCAA Football Community Day are any indication. I still strongly suggest renting before buying, but I&rsquo;m hopeful that this means that the EA football games (which had become quite good in the last couple of years on the old consoles) will finally hit the next-gen consoles with the same level of quality that they slowly built up to in the last generation.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s July, so there isn&rsquo;t much releasing this month. But the new, slimmed down E3 starts next week, so hopefully we will see some exciting announcements. I am particularly looking for some more news on the PS3 front, as the Xbox 360 already has a very healthy release list for the rest of the year and belong. I also want to see if 3rd parties are rushing to provide good games for the Wii, now that the little console-that-could has sold so well.</p>

<p>2007, <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/raster-noton/">raster-noton</a></p>

<p>Style: <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/minimal">minimal</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/glitch">glitch</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/ambient">ambient</a></p>

<p>For some people, the making of this album will be more interesting than the final result. On this recording, Alva Noto (Carsten Nicolai) used sound sources from real life (advertisements, entertainment, elevator music, etc), and then used software that made many (degrading) copies of the sounds, like a VHS tape copied many times over, until the Nth generation copy-from-a-copy-from-etc sounds were completely unrecognizable from their source material.</p>

<p>The idea is neat, but from reading that description, you might expect to hear a varied (or, at least, unique) sound palette in this recording. Instead, what this cut-and-paste amounts to is mostly buzzing white noise, awash in ambient drones. In that respect, it is somewhat disappointing. While some reviewers have been unable to get past that stumbling block, listeners that can will find that the album is a pretty effective minimal ambient recording. It&rsquo;s coldly beautiful, light without being schmaltz. It&rsquo;s a different sound than fans of previous Alva Noto recordings are familiar with, but it should appeal to that crowd still.</p>

<p>There is, unfortunately, not a lot of depth here. It&rsquo;s unessential, but very enjoyable.</p>

The group first gained attention with their first EP, which was well-received if criticized for being too similar to the music of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Explosions+in+the+Sky">Explosions in the Sky</a>. The first few tracks on The Four Trees does little to give the listener the impression that things are any different this time around. However, later tracks show the band incorporating some more elements into their sound, even if those elements too are post-rock staples.</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, if you&rsquo;ve heard of post-rock, you&rsquo;ve heard this all before. What&rsquo;s surprising is how well <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Caspian">Caspian</a> pulls it off anyway. Despite the unshakable familiarity of the whole album, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like a second-rate copy. The instruments are sharp. The compositions are quite good, with lack of originality being the only immediate complaint to offer. The recording quality is solid and well-mixed, avoiding the messy sound other second-tier post-rock recordings tend to have during the loud crescendos. All in all, it&rsquo;s a pretty nice package.</p>

<p>Given that this is the group&rsquo;s first full-length release, there is hope for the future. These guys play too well to stay in the copycat artist camp. Hopefully they come to evolve into a more distinct sound of their own. Heavy fans of the post-rock genre will find plenty to like here, while everyone else should just stay tuned and keep an eye out for album #2.</p>

<p>Caspian &ndash; Moksha</p>

<p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Grails">Grails</a> &ndash; Burning Off Impurities</p>

<p>2007, <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Temporary+Residence/">Temporary Residence</a></p>

<p>Style: <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/post-rock">post-rock</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/psych%20rock">psych rock</a></p>

<p>When Western bands play music with strong non-Western influences (I&rsquo;m avoiding terms like &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; and &ldquo;world music&rdquo; here), the results often fall into a few familiar tracks. There&rsquo;s the &ldquo;Van Halen effect&rdquo; (named after the many &lsquo;80s hair metal bands that attempted to copy Van Halen but only cloned the surface elements, without truly understanding the substance of what they were imitating), where the artist only produces a shallow facsimile of the influences pulled from. Then there&rsquo;s the &ldquo;oil and water effect&rdquo;, where the artist attempts to take two very different elements and fails to find a way to mix them into a natural and fluid combination. And then there are those attempts that are just so ham-fisted as to be painfully bad in every way.</p>

<p>When an artist manages to avoid these traps, however, they have an opportunity to create something beautiful. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Grails">Grails</a>&lsquo; Burning Off Impurities is a good example of this, an album that incorporates various non-Western influences into a musical style informed by modern psychedelic and post-rock, and soaked in reverb.</p>

<p>Structure is very loose here, and the sustained, reverberated guitars create an ethereal sound. Indeed, the whole album feels like something you don&rsquo;t directly experience, but only witness through a haze, like barely seeing a boat on the water through thick coastal fog. The experience feels very indirect, and the elements of the music are just out of reach. Tracks are not songs so much as melodies that emerge from the haze like a plane breaking through the clouds, and seep right back into the haze when done. The music, thankfully, is not as awkward and bumbling as my metaphors. :)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to get lost in this album, and although I wouldn&rsquo;t categorize the tracks as being overly &ldquo;samey&rdquo;, the aloof nature of the music can make it easy for the listener to lose focus. Multiple listens are necessary before one can get a good handle on what&rsquo;s going on, and even still I find me forcing myself to focus on the music and not get lost in the fog. When I am focused, however, the rewards are great. Another great <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Temporary+Residence/">Temporary Residence</a> release. That label is having one hell of a 2007 so far.</p>

<p>Grails &ndash; Burning Off Impurities</p>

<p>(live at the Spanish Moon in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on May 5, 2007)</p>

<p>2007, <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Monotreme+Records/">Monotreme Records</a></p>

<p>Style: <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/post-rock">post-rock</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/math%20rock">math rock</a></p>

<p>65daysofstatic has until now been known for a blend of post-rock and dnb-style electronics. With <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/65daysofstatic/The+Destruction+Of+Small+Ideas">The Destruction Of Small Ideas</a> (dammit Last.fm, lowercase the &ldquo;of&rdquo;!), the electronics have largely faded into the background, and the intensity has been kicked up in its place. Many people use the word &ldquo;bludgeon&rdquo; to describe this album. Indeed, when 65daysofstatic launches into loud wall-of-sound sections, they are driven by rapid-fire drums that certainly suggest blunt force violence. Soft, whisper-like piano lines, sparse but beautiful strings, and strategically placed noise and electronics color the sound into something much more distinct from many generic post-rock acts.</p>

<p>This album takes some time to digest. There is very little repetition, so it can be difficult to make an immediate connection with some of the material. Persistence is rewarded, however, as after a half-dozen listens, everything begins to fall into place. For me, it was like a light switch &ndash; I went from nearly taking this off the iPod to loving it to death.</p>

<p>At 61 minutes, this album could certainly have used some trimming. None of the material really screams to be cut (though the guest vocals on the last track do nothing but hinder an otherwise good piece), but everything would have gained from keeping the album at a more manageable size (and creating a bit more balance between the sonic assaults and the softer sections).</p>

<p>Fantastic album. The critical reception has, unfortunately, been spotty at best. Of course, if I wrote about this after only 3 or so spins, I wouldn&rsquo;t have had much great to say about it either. There&rsquo;s plenty of substance here, and the patient listener will find plenty to delight in &ndash; after a few listens.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Maserati">Maserati</a> &ndash; Inventions for the New Season</p>

<p>2007, <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Temporary+Residence/">Temporary Residence</a></p>

<p>Style: <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/post-rock">post-rock</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/neo-krautrock">neo-krautrock</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/space%20rock">space rock</a></p>

<p>Holy smokes!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still reeling from listening to this album all day. <a href="http://www.last.fm/label/Temporary+Residence/">Temporary Residence</a>&rsquo;s site described the album as &ldquo;a bloodshot, 3AM soundtrack to a Michael Mann movie that hasn&rsquo;t happened yet; a sweaty, delirious mix of mid-to-late 70s Pink Floyd, German psych-rock, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/krautrock">krautrock</a>, and mid-80s action film scores.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is all of those things, and yet none of them. All of these elements are in the mix, but nothing sounds distinctly derivative from any of it. It&rsquo;s a great fusion of classic prog/space/krautrock with math/post-rock. Dual guitar interplay at times reminds of modern <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/King+Crimson">King Crimson</a>. Spacey atmospherics (usually with a locked-in groove moving things alone) remind of the best of instrumental <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>. Pulsing sounds and steady, repetitious percussion reminds of Neu, or <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Circle">Circle</a>. One of the guitarists is from <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Turing+Machine">Turing Machine</a>, a math-rock band that I like a lot but doesn&rsquo;t get name-dropped very much. Elements of that band are here too, but while Turing Machine has a bit of a one-dimensional (but still great) sound, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Maserati">Maserati</a> has some range.</p>

<p>Complaints? Well, you could complain that the compositions, while intricate, aren&rsquo;t necessarily mind-bendingly complex. This would, of course, be missing the point.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m confused as to whether this album really is this great, or if it just hits a sweet spot for me. I get concerned when I find myself struggling to offer a critique of something. There has been high praise on the Temporary Residence forum from some people, so I know at least I&rsquo;m not the only one high on it.</p>

<p>Expect to see this on my end-of-year top 10 list. There&rsquo;s a great chance that it will be right at the top.</p>

<p>Fantastic, unusual, experimental release, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Amon+Tobin">Amon Tobin</a>&rsquo;s first true studio album in 5 years. This is very much a departure from his classic studio albums. More often, the album&rsquo;s tone is evocative of the Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory soundtrack, except without the restrictions that soundtrack pieces have to abide by. It&rsquo;s cut from a lot of field recordings and real instrumentation, including a track that incorporates the Kronos Quartet. It strays even further away from any dance roots present in previous Amon Tobin studio albums, and has received flak from fans of dance music for it. It&rsquo;s NOT just an exercise in sound manipulation, though, as Tobin does a great job of incorporating melody, sometimes with very subtle means. This strikes me as a transition record, not yet a final destination. I&rsquo;m not sure what kind of legs it will have, but so far I think it&rsquo;s pretty fantastic and I&rsquo;m glad to see Tobin pushing forward and not settling into familiar patterns.</p>

<p>From the sound of the detractors, you&rsquo;d think Explosions in the Sky is the new AC/DC, with a ton of same-sounding albums. This is, of course, only their 4th studio album (and you can pretty much forget the 1st one, a not-yet-ready-for-prime-time release that the band resisted reissuing until fan demand became too great to ignore). On the surface, this sounds very much like the past 3 albums, but to leave things at that is to make a very shallow comparison. The last album took away some of the edge from the band&rsquo;s 2nd album, while this album regains some of that edge in a more concise form. Instrumental buildups are more abbreviated here, and some piano-driven melodies add some extra color to the band&rsquo;s typical twangy guitar sound. This is an excellent album, I&rsquo;d probably rank it #2 behind 2001&rsquo;s &ldquo;Those Who Tell the Truth&hellip;.&rdquo;. It does seem to be a bit of a transitional album, and hopefully the band will continue to diversify around their great core sound.</p>
