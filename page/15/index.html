  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you that read this site are already well aware of the <a href="http://www.gamerswithjobs.com">Gamers With Jobs</a> website. For those that aren&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s the place to go for a live, vibrant community of intelligent gamers. Thanks to very strict (by Internet standards) behavior control, the only people that remain on the site are those that can exhibit a basic level of intellect and good behavior. It&rsquo;s the kind of place that shouldn&rsquo;t be rare on the Internet, but is.</p>

<p>What has this to do with me? Well, the GWJ crew recently created an additional website. This one is a &ldquo;news blog&rdquo; &ndash; intelligent gaming news with a little blog activity from the writers thrown in. This site is called the <a href="http://passthepress.com">Gamers With Jobs Press Pass</a>, and a couple of weeks ago, I joined the crew of writers. It&rsquo;s a great source for interesting gaming news, without a bunch of rumor mongering or idle speculation. I&rsquo;m excited to be a part of it, and the activity in recent days has made me start to believe that it will eventually grow quite an audience with its level of discourse and character.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a gamer, give the site a look. Bookmark it or throw the RSS feed to your aggregator. And if you&rsquo;re interested in gaming forums without the idiocy, visit the main GWJ site.</p>

<p>Apologies if this post sounds an awful lot like an advertisement. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One week before we had been dating for exactly four years, I asked Stacey to marry me. But not quite so simply.</p>

<p>No, first, she had to run all over town in a &ldquo;scavenger hunt&rdquo; patterned after The Amazing Race, complete with Logan serving as cameraman with his fine Sony HD camcorder.</p>

<p>At each stop of the &ldquo;race&rdquo;, she would find a relative or friend. Three of her friends came from out of town to participate. She had to do various tasks like find a certain item inside a store, paint a picture, race a go-kart, and (my favorite) participate in a miniature NFL combine, complete with 40-yard-dash time and Wonderlic test. Perhaps the best moment is when she didn&rsquo;t know what the word &ldquo;gridiron&rdquo; referred to, and she ended up asking people in the mall what it meant &ndash; finally getting an answer from former Oakland Raider and AFL Hall of Fame receiver Art Powell, who was signing autographs in the mall.</p>

<p>At the end, she found everyone waiting for her at the restaurant at which we had our first date. There, I proposed to her, she accepted (this was a foregone conclusion &ndash; she had been pretty much bugging me to hurry up the proposal for some time ), and we all enjoyed a wonderful Japanese food dinner.</p>

<p>Soon, we will shoot some B-roll, and take all of that film and cut it together into a TV-style broadcast, complete with dramatic soundtrack and all that fun stuff. We&rsquo;ll master it to a DVD, and keep it forever.</p>

<p>Stacey has a <a href="http://queenstacey-25.livejournal.com/60784.html">more complete account</a> of the events on her journal. I don&rsquo;t have the energy to try and describe it as she did, and I was at &ldquo;mission control&rdquo; the whole time anyway. Needless to say, organizing and executing this plan was a LOT of work and planning, and the logistics were my biggest stressing point.</p>

<p>Stacey has also created a <a href="http://staceyandbrendon.weddingannouncer.com/">website at weddingannouncer.com</a> where information of our wedding-to-be will be posted. She&rsquo;s got some stuff up now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My website (<a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com">economyofeffort.com</a>, in case you&rsquo;re reading this on one of my blog mirrors) has hosted my personal &ldquo;wish list&rdquo; for some time. The idea has been to give friends and relatives an easy way of finding things to buy me on gift-giving occasions.</p>

<p>Finally, a new website has come along to handle wish lists &ndash; MasterWish (<a href="http://www.masterwish.com">www.masterwish.com</a>). It makes creating online wish lists a lot easier. The &ldquo;Wish List&rdquo; link in my menu to the right will lead to a page that takes you to various sections of my MasterWish list. The site&rsquo;s got buddy lists, Amazon.com integration, and some other neat features. I had thought about writing a web-based wish list application, but this site renders that exercise unnecessary.</p>

<p>Some people think such lists are tacky, but honestly, nobody wants to give a bad present. Nobody likes trying to buy gifts for someone and having no idea what to get. And perhaps worst of all, nobody wants to buy someone something they already have. I love it when other people have wish lists to go from, if for nothing else but a starting point.</p>

<p>So, anyway, a new website for you all. Do your love ones a favor and put an end to the gift-buying guessing game. And save yourself trips to the store for returning crappy gifts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Generally, I don&rsquo;t care for the stereotypical geek pursuit of trying to get one&rsquo;s significant other into the &ldquo;geek hobbies&rdquo;. Usually such attempts, while well meaning, are ill conceived. So it is perhaps with a bit of hypocricy that I follow the same pursuit. At least in my case, Stacey has an interest in gaming &ndash; one which I am simply trying to locate and help amplify. Stacey has, admirably, broadened her entertainment horizons on many fronts in the time that we&rsquo;ve been together. I have tried to do my part as well, and in these past 4 years, I have become more intimately familiar with the offerings of the Disney Channel than I ever thought possible. I have a very broad range of entertainment choices, and so it hasn&rsquo;t been too difficult to find some that Stacey would become interested in and establish some common ground.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/11/93010004_2e8c99a0b2_m.jpg" alt="" /> In terms of games, Stacey was an NES child, much like myself. My NES game stash nearly doubled when she dug up the old games her and her younger brother owned. Although Stacey&rsquo;s games have tended to be outside of the &ldquo;hardcore&rdquo;, some have been reasonably distant from the typical &ldquo;games girls play&rdquo; (like The Sims).</p>

<p>Stacey&rsquo;s currently on a kick for two games. The first is Katamari Damacy. And who doesn&rsquo;t understand the appeal of that game? Roll a ball around and pick up a bunch of crap. Certainly a &ldquo;female friendly&rdquo; game, but a bit more of a gamer&rsquo;s game than Animal Crossing (another game Stacey was once hooked on, but that&rsquo;s another topic). She&rsquo;s progressed to the last &frac14;th of the game, and she&rsquo;s ready to jump into the sequel &ldquo;We Love Katamari&rdquo; as soon as possible.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/27/93010003_ca5549f2db_m.jpg" alt="" /> The only time Stacey&rsquo;s uninterested in Katamari Damacy is when she wants to hook her claws on her other current game of choice: Guitar Hero. Now I love this game a lot. One thing that surprised me is how close it feels to playing an actual guitar. I&rsquo;ve played the guitar since I was 15 (holy hell that&rsquo;s been a long time now) and though I&rsquo;ve never aspired to virtuoso &ldquo;metal god&rdquo; status, I can rock more than well enough to star in a radio-rock alternative band. :)  So at least I have a decent idea of what playing a guitar is like. I&rsquo;m shocked at how well they nailed it with the little Gibson SG style controller. When I progressed to harder songs that required speedy hammer-ons and pull-offs to hit the notes, it felt like rockin&#8217; a real guitar.</p>

<p>Stacey, meanwhile, is not a guitar player, but that sure doesn&rsquo;t seem to make any difference at all. She doesn&rsquo;t quite have the finger dexterity of a guitar player, but her face lights up when she does manage to riff her way through a difficult lick. I enjoy the classic rock and metal cuts like &ldquo;Spanish Castle Magic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Symphony of Destruction&rdquo;, while Stacey likes the newer rock tracks like &ldquo;Take Me Out&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So, two games that are somewhere between the hardcore and the typical &ldquo;girl games&rdquo;. I really can&rsquo;t wait to get a copy of Beyond Good &amp; Evil into her hands &ndash; if stupid Half.com sellers would stop cancelling my orders, that is (if ya don&rsquo;t have it, take down the listing, fools).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/23/91579660_7ca7160f65_m.jpg" alt="" /> Last night, I touched Lord Stanley&rsquo;s Cup. The ECHL All-Star Game was hosted here in Fresno, at the wonderful Save Mart Center. Along for the ride was the Stanley Cup as well as the ECHL&rsquo;s own prize, the Kelly Cup. Stacey and I had our pictures taken with the Cup. The game was also fun, more for the company (Kate and Kristyn) than the game itself.</p>

<p>I have started experimenting with Python and the pygame library, in order to create a quick puzzle game. I need to build up a portfolio of demos, and so I am going to learn some new languages and libraries along the way. I&rsquo;d be so comfortable just jumping into C++ and OpenGL to do everything, but when it comes to skill sets, Wider Is Better.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/11/91579661_655e379883_m.jpg" alt="" /> GameFly sent me the next game I had in my queue: Peter Jackson&rsquo;s King Kong for the Xbox 360. I&rsquo;ve played it for about half an hour. Very pretty game, seems like a well-executed concept too. One complaint: playing it on my VGA monitor in 1280x1024, the picture appears as if it is rendered in 16:9 but then letterboxed on top of that too. The viewing size is VERY short. I&rsquo;ve noticed a few graphical gotchas in playing the 360 on a VGA display, rather than an SDTV or an HDTV. I appreciate it when games are letterboxed, but I think there&rsquo;s something funky going on in this case. No matter &ndash; I&rsquo;ll still play through anything Michel Ansel (Beyond Good and Evil) creates from here on out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK, maybe not so much with the &ldquo;profit&rdquo;, but plenty of the &ldquo;fun&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I have a history of using old hardware for new purposes. I currently have a media server / router box in my room that is (mostly) a computer that I built for my best friend some 6-7 years ago. I&rsquo;ve refurbished machines for family members, and torn parts out of spare systems to repair or upgrade others peoples&#8217; systems.</p>

<p>Now, game consoles are getting in on the action. I had planned on modding my Xbox once I got an Xbox 360. And, as of a few days ago, I finally went ahead and did it.</p>

<p>Some research and help from neighborhood friendly <a href="http://www.gamerswithjobs.com">Gamers With Jobs</a> made the entire process very smooth and simple. I found out that I did not, in fact, need a modchip at all. Instead, a &ldquo;soft mod&rdquo; would serve all of my purposes easily.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/legion28old/87324056"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/38/87324056_99cca4fefb.jpg" alt="Xbox" /></a> My goals were two in number: to be able to watch IPTV (video podcasts and such) on my television, and to be able to emulate all of my old consoles from the early &lsquo;90s on back (so that I can leave that hardware in storage). These goals, as it turned out, were very easily achieved.</p>

<p>To perform the softmod, I needed the Krayzie Ndure Softmod Pack (found on your nearest Bittorrent search engine) and a Pro Action Replay USB. The Pro Action Replay is usually used for downloading &ldquo;cheat&rdquo; savegames from the Internet to a memory card that plugs into the Xbox controllers. For my purposes, the save game was a &ldquo;hack&rdquo; from the Ndure pack, which would almost completely automate the process of installing a new BIOS and dashboard, as well as backing up the original stuff. All I needed was a copy of the original Splinter Cell (which I never got rid of) and I was off.</p>

<p>After the Ndure install finished, I had a modded Xbox running the Evolution-X dashboard. That allowed me to FTP into the Xbox from my laptop. For emulators and other apps (like Xbox Media Center), one need fire up their IRC client, and head to EFNet and #xbins. Or, if you have a nice legal copy of the Xbox Development Kit (and who doesn&rsquo;t?), you can just download the source code from the project websites and build it yourself. Either way, once the binaries are built, it&rsquo;s just a matter of FTP-ing into the Xbox and uploading them into the &ldquo;Apps&rdquo; and &ldquo;Emus&rdquo; folders.</p>

<p>Xbox Media Center had little trouble getting onto my Samba network and pulling video files from my media server on demand. I tweaked a copy of the <a href="http://linc.homeunix.org:8080/scripts/bashpodder/">Bashpodder</a> podcast client script to download and store video podcasts in a particular folder, and told XBMC to look in that folder. Voila, it streams the video from my server whenever I browse to view a video.</p>

<p>Which leads me to my initial list of must-see video podcasts:
<a href="http://digitallifetv.com/blogs/digitallifetv/default.aspx">DigitalLife TV</a> (Patrick Norton and Robert Heron from TechTV, doing a 45 minute tech show)
<a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/">Rocketboom</a> (a daily 3-minute mini-show, loosely about tech and the Internet, with a very cute anchorwoman)
<a href="http://www.1up.com/flat/Podcasts/vodcasts.xml">1UP TV</a> (good gaming TV)
<a href="http://revision3.com/diggnation">Diggnation</a> (Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht discussing stories from digg.com &ndash; probably more enjoyable than digg itself)
<a href="http://www.tikibartv.com/">Tiki Bar TV</a> (ummm&hellip; it&rsquo;s kind of like a recurring skit about a new cocktail each time, except with less structure and more funny. And LaLa is hot)</p>

<p>I have some others subscribed to but not yet viewed.</p>

<p>Anyway &ndash; I got some good answers to my question in the last post about games for my parents. They bought Mario Kart, as well as an old copy of Madden for $5 to try out. And I imagine they will go get Mario Tennis after they&rsquo;ve worn their current stash out a bit more.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m waiting on a copy of Beyond Good &amp; Evil to arrive in the mail, as a Christmas present for my girlfriend (which should have been here around Christmas, but the tool I originally ordered it from on Half.com sat around for a week and cancelled the order January 3rd, without a word). But that&rsquo;s a discussion for another post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think it is safe to say that the GameCube has gone over smashingly well at my parents&#8217; house.</p>

<p>I got a call from my dad this evening, as I was out driving to get some dinner. He informed me that he and my mother had played a full 18 holes of Mario Golf the night before. My mom was up by 10 strokes, but she started to slump and my dad came back to win by a couple of strokes. He was extremely proud of himself. I wasn&rsquo;t surprised to find out that he has been having fun with it, but I was surprised that he has roped my mom into it too. Not that I blame either of them. GAMES ARE FUN. We gave them some games without a punishing learning curve, and the simplistic GameCube controller, and they&rsquo;re off to the races. The simple elegance of the GameCube itself, and the comfortable wireless WaveBird controllers, only help matters.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/36/84778363_8020686592_m.jpg" alt="" /> The two of them will be adding some racing games to their collection &ndash; Mario Kart obviously, and maybe something else (I&rsquo;ll have to check the review scores to find something to recommend &ndash; any ideas?). I think my dad is also interested in getting a football game (there&rsquo;s only one choice now &ndash; Madden &ndash; which thankfully has improved much this year).</p>

<p>Most importantly, I think the two of them are getting over the &ldquo;fear&rdquo; (&ldquo;intimidation&rdquo; is perhaps more appropriate) of new, high-tech games. Tetris and Dr. Mario may have been long ago, but there&rsquo;s still simple enough games out there to play.</p>

<p>I will admit, I have come to appreciate Nintendo a bit more. Though their next console will still be the last one I buy (probably, though the lower price might help), I think there is plenty of need for simple games with low barriers to entry. I have been looking forward to the day where the game console world splits into more targeted markets instead of every console duking it out for the right to be everything to everyone.</p>

<p>And if anyone has any ideas of GameCube games that aren&rsquo;t punishing to the player (ie. &ldquo;failure&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t equal death and a stop to gameplay), please share them with me. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I admit it &ndash; for a long time, I have been using two passwords for everything. Neither were particularly strong passwords &ndash; both 8 characters or less, and only one wasn&rsquo;t all letters. That has finally changed, thanks to a little program called <a href="http://keepass.sourceforge.net/">KeePass</a>.</p>

<p>KeePass is a free, open-source program for creating and managing passwords. It lets you create random passwords of any length, and saves them in an encrypted, password-protected database. The idea is that you memorize only one password (for the database), and then you create a bunch of random passwords that you don&rsquo;t ever need to actually know &ndash; you just access them from KeePass when you need them. It lets you copy a password to the clipboard with a quick click, and then it clears the clipboard after 10 seconds (so that nobody can come along later and repeat the &ldquo;Paste&rdquo; action).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/legion28old/79274707"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/39/79274707_b68222dd3e.jpg" alt="KeePass screenshot" /></a></p>

<p>KeePass is a Windows app, but has also been ported to Linux and Mac OS X. I haven&rsquo;t tried the Mac version yet, but the Linux port is great &ndash; a near-perfect replication of the Windows version.</p>

<p>Now I have strong passwords for everything that matters, and even places that don&rsquo;t. Even if you don&rsquo;t use it for crazy strong passwords, it is useful for storing usernames and passwords for all your websites &ndash; because you can never get the same username and password for every site, and sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to remember them for sites that you don&rsquo;t go to everyday. It&rsquo;s much nicer to have them stored in your KeePass database. And you can copy the database to a thumb drive and take your passwords with you &ndash; just install KeePass on the computer that you&rsquo;re using (probably not a good solution for public terminals, but it&rsquo;s great for going back and forth between a work PC and a home PC). Since the database is encrypted, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about losing your thumb drive or having someone hop on your computer and pulling up the database &ndash; they&rsquo;d have to break the encryption first. (Saving passwords in your browser might defeat that, but then at least you&rsquo;re only exposed if they have physical access to your PC, and you pretty much are exposed in that event anyway).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great program, and if you get yourself in the habit of using it, it becomes a convenience much more than a hassle &ndash; especially for the ability to manage various usernames and passwords for different websites.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My dad (who is actually 51, but the round number 50 makes for a better title) has not been a steady video game player for many years. He was part of the Atari generation, and my early years &ndash; some too early to even remember &ndash; were spent surrounded by Pac-Man and Berzerk. Somewhere around Super Mario Bros., however, my dad got left behind on the gaming learning curve. Now, he is approaching his retirement, and what&rsquo;s more, he will have grandchildren somewhere down the road &ndash; and any children I have will be game players from the moment they can hold a controller. Not to mention the fact that I expect him to play anything that I get to work on. :)</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m challenging him to get back into playing games. I told him, if he starts now, he&rsquo;ll be able to play them for the rest of his life. But if he sits and waits longer, it will get to the point where he&rsquo;s not able to catch up. I&rsquo;m reminded of the George Bernard Shaw quote, &ldquo;We do not stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.&rdquo; Keep playing = stay young, not to mention a never-ending stream of mental challenges to help keep one sharp.</p>

<p>For Christmas, Logan and I packed up his unused GameCube, and threw in a copy of Super Smash Bros. Melee. Then, I went and bought a copy of Mario Golf to go with it. The GameCube was an easy choice for a nice, easy to use system and stable of games. For the games, I wanted ones that don&rsquo;t terminate gameplay for doing something &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; (like falling into a hole). With a game like Mario Golf, you may end up 7 strokes over par, but you get to <em>keep playing</em>. With SSB, you at least get to wail on each other for a while, plus you can set the game on &ldquo;Very Easy&rdquo; and the computer pretty much stands there and lets you wail on them. And both are very easy to pick up and don&rsquo;t require much more than hitting the &ldquo;A&rdquo; button to handle the basic gameplay elements.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day, after we opened presents and were waiting for the extended family to come, I hooked up the Cube in my parents&#8217; bedroom. He was able to successfully play a couple of holes of golf, and sure seemed impressed by the visuals that the GameCube pumped out (it&rsquo;s definitely a long way from Atari).</p>

<p>Hopefully this is the start of a long-running series of posts. I think he&rsquo;ll have a lot of fun with those two games, and get used to having a controller in his hands again, and manipulating onscreen stuff with a series of buttons. It&rsquo;s easy to learn to play games, but it helps to have something easy and newbie-friendly to play while you get used to the basics.</p>
