  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Drove down to my parents&#8217; house today (since everyone came up to visit me, it was time for me to head down there m&#8217;self). Took a stack of CDs, as usual. Among them was Hands <em>Palm Mystery</em>. I didn&rsquo;t get into this the first time I heard it, so I wanted to give it another shot. The verdict? Errrrmm&hellip;&hellip; still not really digging it. I understand that their self-titled 2nd album is better. Still, this one seems just like the Yezda Urfa that I recently acquired (<em>Sacred Baboon</em>)&hellip; they just aren&rsquo;t appealing to me very much. Is symphonic rock losing it&rsquo;s grip on me? Good instrumental symph still appeals to me much (like Pulsar&rsquo;s <em>Halloween</em> and Shylock&rsquo;s <em>Ile de Fievre</em>). But stuff with vocals is failing to grab me, outside of some of the faves like Gentle Giant. Classic Italian symph seems to be exempt from this, but newer stuff (like La Torre dell&#8217;Alchimista) does not.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s run a counter. It basically started when the Yezda Urfa failed to &ldquo;0wn&rdquo; me when I first listened to it, one week ago. Sooooo&hellip; it has been <strong>7</strong> days since a new-to-me, non-instrumental, non-fave, non-classic-Italian symphonic rock album has &ldquo;0wned&rdquo; me. Let&rsquo;s see what album manages to break this funk.</p>

<p>Of the other CDs that made the drive with me, Henry Cow <em>Leg End (original mix)</em>, Ui <em>The Iron Apple EP</em>, and Weidorje&rsquo;s self-titled all were pleasing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p><em>What should we do today?</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Listened to Tortoise&rsquo;s <em>TNT</em> on the way to work/school today. Haven&rsquo;t dug that out in a while, but it re-affirmed why it is still my favorite Tortoise disc.</p>

<p>Later, after classes, I drove around running a few errands, and had Miles Davis&rsquo;s <em>Bitches Brew</em> in the CD player. Actually, the <em>Complete Bitches Brew Sessions</em>, CD #1. You know, I might end up buying the regular 2CD version of that album, despite having the 4CD box set. It&rsquo;s great music to listen to while driving (good jazz/fusion tends to be), but the box packaging is not very convienent for the car. Same with Magma&rsquo;s <em>Trilogie Au Trianon</em> &ndash; despite being a compact box, it&rsquo;s still not convienent. I like jewel cases because I can open them up, take the CD out, and put the CD into my car stereo without ever taking my eyes off the road. And here&rsquo;s a safe driving trick: when you have a bunch of CDs in the car and need to find a certain one, just grab one and hold it up next to your view of the road, and glance at it. You can see what it is, and not take your eyes off the road for any longer than you do to glance at your rear-view mirrors and such. If it&rsquo;s not the right one, then put it down and grab the next one. Might take a few tries, but it&rsquo;s MUCH safer than looking down and digging through them and not paying attention to the road. Don&rsquo;t hit me with your car!</p>

<p>Anyway, after all that, I went home. I was tired, and the couch looked inviting. I took this opportunity to listen to Tarantel&rsquo;s <em>From Bone To Satellite</em>. I need to get my booty up to San Francisco and see these guys play live. I missed an opportunity to see them and Zoviet*France (and meet a friend from rec.music.progressive) because my job started that week. But Tarantel is located in SF, so I should get a chance to see them. I wasn&rsquo;t seeing anything while listening to <em>From Bone To Satellite</em>, though, as I dozed off on the couch. When I awoke, I looked at the clock and noticed that my Physics class had already started. Whoops. Oh well, it wasn&rsquo;t an important day of class, so no big deal.</p>

<p>After swinging by my boss&rsquo;s house to pick up her computer (doing some maintenance work on it), I went driving around town. I had Fates Warning&rsquo;s <em>A Pleasant Shade of Gray</em> in the car stereo. Damn, but that&rsquo;s a hell of an album. It&rsquo;s one of the indispensable discs in my collection. I didn&rsquo;t much like it when I first got it, but back then, my notion of &ldquo;prog&rdquo; was musical gymnastics a la Dream Theater. Over time, that perception eroded, and the Fates Warning disc was given it&rsquo;s chance to shine. I think I may have told this story here before, but too bad. You get to read it again.</p>

<p>So, while driving in town, listening to Fates, I stopped at Tower Records. I was distraught when I noticed that not even Tortoise were in their &ldquo;rock&rdquo; section. I tend to judge music stores by their &ldquo;indie&rdquo; stock (after all, you can get Fleetwood Mac CDs anywhere). Well, after not seeing anything at all, I started looking for the jazz section. Maybe they at least had the Art Blakey album I want. Well, I looked and looked, and did not find a jazz section anywhere (despite a number of jazz artists, like Louis Armstrong, appearing in the budget bins). While searching, however, I found an &ldquo;indie&rdquo; section to the store. And what do you know, there was the Tortoise and Mogwai, and more. The Sea and Cake, Tarantel, even some prog-metal (Therion, Symphony X, and Zero Hour) were there. Woo! Also some electronic artists like Isis. Lots of San Francisco indie band lovin&#8217; (like Tarantel and Neurosis, but no Sleepytime Gorilla Museum&hellip; <em>sigh</em>). The sections were divided up by genre (rock, industrial, spacerock, metal, etc.) Well, I grabbed the Tarantel (their new album, <em>The Order of Things</em>) as well as a copy of Wire magazine (with the Japanese psych-rock band that I just read about at Pitchfork and downloaded an album of &ndash; Acid Mothers Temple). I&rsquo;ve wanted to read an issue of Wire for a while now, and since their cover story is a band that I am very freshly interested in, now seemed as good of a time as any.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m home now, listening to Tarantel and opening up the Wire mag.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>I live!</p></blockquote>

<p>Damn, it&rsquo;s been a month! My approximately tri-weekly posts disappeared for a full month. Why is that, you ask? Well, pretty much for the same reasons as last month&rsquo;s post: moving, becoming acquainted with a new city, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Odd musical obsession for the week: Spiral Architect&rsquo;s <em>A Sceptic&rsquo;s Universe</em> has continuously found it&rsquo;s way into my various CD players after months of absence. As someone that doesn&rsquo;t much care for metal (prog or otherwise), it&rsquo;s odd to enjoy an album like this one as much as I do. Things that would normally bother me, like the lead singer&rsquo;s occasional (well, maybe a little more regular than occasional) screetches and howls, don&rsquo;t really phase me on this record. The mixing job on this album is something that I specifically like. The bass is mixed up-front and cleanly, and thus doesn&rsquo;t get lost behind the rhythm guitar wall-of-sound (something that seems to happen on a number of metal albums &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know the last time that I specifically heard John Myung in a non-bass-solo part). Maybe the bass up-front mixing would be considered amateurish by some seasoned studio wizards. All I can say for sure is that <em>I</em> find it preferable to the more typical &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the bass? It&rsquo;s in there!&rdquo; metal productions.</p>

<p>I can not sing. However, that never seems to stop me from trying.</p>

<p>King Crimson&rsquo;s <em>The Nightwatch</em> 2CD live set has been a regular in my stereos as well. I sure do enjoy a lot of the <em>Starless &amp; Bible Black</em> material sans-overdubs.</p>

<p>I want a cello. Maybe when I find a job and begin earning some money, I might buy myself one.</p>

<p>Everyone&rsquo;s copy of NHL 2001 should have the Alamaailman Vasarat &ldquo;dittie&rdquo; that I have customized in my own. Only in my virtual NHL arenas can one hear Vasarat, Ratt, Birdsongs of the Mesozoic, Whitesnake, Kenso, Quiet Riot, Deus Ex Machina, and Night Ranger in the span of a few minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Motoring! What&rsquo;s your price for flight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If I were granted only one wish from a magic genie, I would use it to secure my financial future for life and for the lives of my future offspring (and their reproductive achievements, and so on). But if I had TWO wishes, I would use the second one to get a lock of Steve Wilson&rsquo;s hair!</p>

<p>I bought the new remaster of <em>Leftoverture</em> by Kansas. The quality is good, but the disc raises a complaint about the inclusion of bonus tracks. Now, while I am usually a strong &ldquo;bonus track advocate&rdquo;, the two lackluster live tunes that have been grafted to the end of this rather nice album really rub me the wrong way. I mean, they bite. The vocal performances bring tears of pain to my eyes, and the eyes of anyone within earshot. Certainly not all live Kansas could have been this poor? Surely someone has soundboard tapes of really good performances locked away somewhere. These selections sound as if those responsible for the CD&rsquo;s production just grabbed the nearest Kansas live tape and ran with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cum on feel the noize! Girls rock your boyz!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;vox estote Vos: principes muti eae com sint, leges vos loquentes. Eis ex principiis perpetuis omnes homimum easus et actiones dirigenda!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was going to type more, but NHL 2001 calls to me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>These last couple of weeks, pursuing young women has taken a back-seat (no pun intended!) to a score of more pressing concerns. To be precise, I now have a university to transfer to (California State University, Fresno), an apartment (a 1-bedroom loft about two minutes away from CSUF, which I will be completely moved into after finishing my finals next week), and the ever-nearing end of my 4th and final semester at Porterville. After I finish moving and dealing with all of that crap, I will resume my regularly scheduled getting-shot-down-repeatedly. :)</p></blockquote>

<p>Some new music bits:</p>

<p>King Crimson&rsquo;s <em>Heavy ConstruKction</em> is surprisingly good. I picked up a copy after some of the #progrock chatters insisted that it was a strong release. It&rsquo;s a 3CD live set, with the 3rd CD consisting entirely of improvs. Good stuff.</p>

<p>Tortoise&rsquo;s <em>Standards</em> and Mogwai&rsquo;s <em>Rock Action</em> have grown on me quite a bit. I was pleasantly surprised to see both of these CDs featured at Borders. The Borders mini-blurb called <em>Standards</em> &ldquo;&hellip; perhaps their most accessible offering to date&rdquo;, which I had to chuckle at, because it strikes me as being rather inaccessible compared to <em>TNT</em> or <em>Millions Now Living Will Never Die</em>. Not that I would call <em>Standards</em> &ldquo;inaccessible&rdquo; on it&rsquo;s own, but as it relates to those two, yeah.</p>

<p>Magma&rsquo;s <em>Theusz Hamtaahk</em> box set is a wonderful little package. I must shamefully admit that I don&rsquo;t own the studio <em>Wurdah Itah</em>, nor do I have <em>Retrospectiw I-II</em> for the first released performance of &ldquo;Theusz Hamtaahk&rdquo;. I do, however, have <em>Mekanik Destructiw Kommandah</em>. The version from this box set seems to have rather weak brass hits, but the drumming is sufficiently powerful.</p>

<p>NeBeLNeST&rsquo;s self-titled album really does something for me. I guess I just have a thing for spacey jams, but a lot of bands in that vein fail to do it for me. Needless to say, I eagerly, eagerly, eagerly await NeBeLNeST&rsquo;s Bob Drake-produced sophomore effort.</p>

<p>Iona&rsquo;s <em>Journey Into The Morn</em>&hellip;. got it from BMG&hellip; y&#8217;know, I like this album a lot more than I ought to. I probably should hate it. But instead, I&rsquo;ve walked around for entire days, singing &ldquo;WiiiiiiiIIIIIIIiiiissdom!&rdquo; to myself&hellip; (God descends over Legion, looks down, laughs, and shouts &ldquo;All your soul are belong to me!&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Some recent grabs that I haven&rsquo;t listen much to yet:</p>

<p>Thinking Plague &ndash; <em>Early Plague Years</em></p>

<p>King Crimson &ndash; <em>Epitaph (2 CD)</em></p>

<p>The Science Group &ndash; <em>A Mere Coincidence</em></p>

<p>&hellip; and about 5 more I can&rsquo;t think of right now. Right now, my room is a mess of boxes, papers, and more boxes (as mentioned above, I&rsquo;m moving into my own apartment in Fresno, so I&rsquo;m packing and moving most of my stuff now, and then will only have to move a few things after finals).</p>

<p>&ldquo;WiiiiiiiIIIIIIIiiiissdom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An interesting side note: a group of us at rec.music.progressive have decided to start a prog concert bootlegs group. Basically, we&rsquo;re going to work with some serious prog show tape collectors, and transfer their tapes to CDR (cleaning them up in the process), and then distribute the CDRs among our group (as well as to the tape collectors). Anyone interested in possibly participating is urged to e-mail me (see &ldquo;E-mail <em>Legion</em>&rdquo; link to the left). We&rsquo;re setting it up so people without tape transfer or CD burning equipment can still participate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>This week has, for the most part, sucked. Of course, every week leading up to the end of a semester sucks. It&rsquo;s just straining, that&rsquo;s all. Anthropology test, Psychology paper, Creative Writing story, and Calculus. Not fun.</p></blockquote>

<p>Music, however, has been great this week. I really &ldquo;clicked&rdquo; with Birdsongs of the Mesozoic&rsquo;s <em>Petrophonics</em>, Godspeed You Black Emperor!&rsquo;s <em>f#a#(infinity)</em>, and Supersister&rsquo;s <em>Present From Nancy</em> this week. I had liked each of them prior to this week, but they each took on a new and higher meaning after being listened to this week.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been downloading a lot of bootleg MP3s. Jaco Pastorius, Dream Theater, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Do Make Say Think, National Health, Miriodor, and A Silver Mt. Zion live bootlegs all now reside on my PC (soon to be archived to CD-R).</p>

<p>Currently listening to Magma&rsquo;s <em>Mekanik Destructiw Kommandah</em>. TOO COOL.</p>

<p>I bought five classical compilation CDs today. I wasn&rsquo;t looking to, but Wal-Mart had the audacity to sell them for only $1.96. One of them is a Tchaikovsky comp, one&rsquo;s a Beethoven comp, one&rsquo;s a Mozart comp, and the other two are piano comps with material from varying composers. I&rsquo;ll most likely replace them as soon as I become a &ldquo;serious&rdquo; classical collector, but they&rsquo;re welcome for now.</p>

<p>As for the girl mentioned last week&hellip; I&rsquo;m thinking about biting the bullet and calling her up tomorrow&hellip;..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Been a while since I&rsquo;ve posted. I&rsquo;ve been on Spring Break, although I haven&rsquo;t gone anywhere. Rather, I have been catching up on some much-needed rest. By the week before break, I was pretty constantly fatigued. I&rsquo;m feeling a bit better, and am ready to finish up the semester.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see, new CDs&hellip; oh yes:</p>

<p>The Who &ndash; Who&rsquo;s Next<br/>
David Tohir and his Backbone &ndash; Angels Dancing in Virga<br/>
Deus Ex Machina &ndash; Equilibrismo da Insofferenza<br/>
NeBeLNeST &ndash; NeBeLNeST<br/>
Charles Mingus &ndash; Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus<br/>
Chick Corea and Return to Forever &ndash; Light as a Feather<br/>
Ornette Coleman &ndash; The Shape of Jazz to Come</p>

<p>I have barely listened to these. You see, for the next week or so, I am instating a policy of only listening to MP3s when at home. I download so much, but a lot of it just sits there. So, for the time being, I am going to listen to MP3s when at home, and CDs when in the car and on foot.</p>

<p>Today, when sitting outside at a shopping center, I was drinking a Coke and listening to the radio that was being played for the seating area. The music mix was interesting. There was some pop, naturally, but then a Steely Dan tune played, and I didn&rsquo;t recognize which one. Furthermore, after that song, a Pink Floyd song played. That in itself was pretty interesting, but what caught my attention was the particular song. It wasn&rsquo;t one of the hits from <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em>, <em>The Wall</em>, <em>Wish You Were Here</em>, or even <em>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</em> or <em>The Division Bell</em>. I was able to identify the song as being something on <em>Meddle</em>, of all albums. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out which one (until I got home, and found out that it was &ldquo;San Tropaz&rdquo;). <em>Very</em> interesting choice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>I started thinking about what else <a href="http://www.bmgmusicservice.com">BMG music club</a> might have to offer me. After all, I have three accounts open right now. I&rsquo;ll need to choose 5 more CDs for each of the first two, and 2 more CDs for the last one (actually 10 more CDs, but I&rsquo;ve decided on 8 of them in the form of Coltrane&rsquo;s <em>Classic Quartet &ndash; Complete Impulse!</em> set). Plus I could open up two more accounts from this address. So, I figured I should check out what box sets BMG has. I was pleasantly surprised to find a bunch of ones that I would want. Check these out:</p></blockquote>

<p>Rock:<br/>
The Police &ndash; Message in a Box (4 CDs)<br/>
Eric Clapton &ndash; Crossroads (4 CDs)<br/>
Alice Cooper &ndash; Life and Crimes of Alice Cooper (4 CDs)<br/>
Led Zeppelin &ndash; Led Zeppelin remastered (4 CDs)<br/>
Lynyrd Skynyrd &ndash; Lynyrd Skynyrd (3 CDs)<br/>
The Who &ndash; 30 Years of Maximum R&amp;B (4 CDs)</p>

<p>Jazz:<br/>
Miles Davis Quintet &ndash; Complete Columbia Studio Recordings (6 CDs)</p>

<p>Classical:<br/>
Complete Works of Bach Vol. 1 (5 CDs)<br/>
Beethoven, The Five Piano Concertos (3 CDs)<br/>
The Complete Chamber Music Of Claude Debussy (3 CDs)<br/>
Brahms, Piano Trios Nos. 1-3; Piano Quartets Nos. 1-3 (3 CD)<br/>
Dvorák, Stabat Mater (2 CDs)<br/>
Godowsky, The Complete Studies On Chopin&rsquo;s Études (2 CDs)</p>

<p>I need to check on the quality of the performances of the classical sets, but the rock ones and the Miles Davis one are definite &ldquo;wants&rdquo;. For my first two accounts, I now need to buy one CD and then take four more free. So I&rsquo;ll find a couple of single CDs to get, and then pick two of the 4 CD sets (I&rsquo;ll probably start with the Alice Cooper and The Who sets). Then, I could start a 4th account with the Skynyrd and Police sets as my first 7 free, then buy one CD, and then get either the Clapton or Zeppelin box sets as the final 4 freebies.</p>

<p>The classical sets are interesting. Some of them actually sell for less than $20. So, instead of buying a single CD to meet the requirements for my other accounts, I could buy one of these sets instead for only a few dollars more. Why take up 3 freebies for the Debussey set when it only costs $16.99 (the same amount of money I would spend for a single CD to meet my membership requirements)?</p>

<p>BMG kicks ass.</p>

<p>While they have a 5 membership per household per address limitation, I could soon do 5 more accounts. Why? Well, I will be moving during the summer as I transfer to a university. New address = new memberships. Woohoo!</p>

<p>Yeah, they scalp on shipping. But look at it this way. Each CD costs about $2.50 to ship. Plus you have to pay full price for one CD (which ranges from $13-17, let&rsquo;s just say $17 for a conservative estimate). So:</p>

<p>$2.50 x 12 CDs = $30<br/>
$17 x 1 = $17<br/>
$30 + $17 = $47 approximate grand total for 12 CD shipped and the one required non-freebie paid for.</p>

<p>If I could walk into a store and pay $47 and walk out with the Who, Cooper, Skynyrd, and Debussey box sets, would I? You bet your arse! This is exactly the same thing, except that you have to wait a week or three (or five) to get them. So what? I&rsquo;m not impatient (of course, I&rsquo;m constantly getting new music, as you can see here in my near-daily entries). What a deal. Most of these box sets eclipse $30 each.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>I spent this weekend in Pismo Beach, which is located in California&rsquo;s beautiful (well, nice) central coast.</p></blockquote>

<p>I was feeling pretty crappy Friday morning, so I skipped my first class, and only went to my second.  Later that afternoon, I helped my folks load up their car, and we departed. While we have made use of on-the-beach hotels in previous Pismo trips, we stayed at a family friend&rsquo;s condo in Grover Beach this time. The nightly rate for the condo was less than half that of Pismo&rsquo;s beachside hotels. I expected the place to be fairly small, but it turned out to be a two story, 3 bedroom condo. I was thoroughly impressed.</p>

<p>This trip is probably the last one I&rsquo;ll take with my parents. Though in reality, I spent most of this trip on my own anyway. I didn&rsquo;t take my own car (a 2001 Hyundai Elantra), but that was only because my parents took their two cars (a 1996 Nissan pickup and a 2001 Hyundai Santa Fe) and gave me the keys to the Santa Fe for use while at Pismo. So there was no need to take a third car.</p>

<p>We arrived Friday night, unpacked, and went to the beach. They went and walked on the beach and the pier, while I walked around downtown (which is just off the beach). The only places that were still open were the bars and the arcade. I spent a few bucks in the arcade, and then headed for the beach myself. After a couple of hours of beach and arcade time, it was getting late, and I joined my parents and brother in returning back to the condo.</p>

<p>The bedrooms were great in this place. The one I stayed in was about the same size as my bedroom at home. The full-size bed was also nice. I don&rsquo;t have a full-size bed. Rather, I have a twin-sized bed with a water mattress. My parents have offered me a full-size bed, but I won&rsquo;t give up my mini-waterbed for anything except a proper waterbed. But anyway, when I do have to sleep abroad, I enjoy having a bed in which my feet actually have mattress underneath them. Anyway, I got in bed, threw Low&rsquo;s <em>Songs for a Dead Pilot</em> EP into my Discman, tossed on my headphones, and relaxed to the wonderful sounds of this Minnesota softcore band.</p>

<p>The next morning (well, closer to noon), I drove back out to the beach. I took my Discman with me, as well as a few CDs. I don&rsquo;t often listen to my Discman when walking around in public, but doing so this weekend has made me re-evaluate my lack of Discman usage. It was quite interesting to walk in a crowd of people listening to various different musics. Initially, I was listening to Labradford&rsquo;s <em>Mi Media Naranja</em>, which was nice and serene. After Labradford was over, I switched to Eskaton&rsquo;s <em>4 Visions</em>. Now that offered a very different experience. I don&rsquo;t quite know how to describe it, but walking down the sidewalk while listening to this French zeuhl band was a unique experience. Walking on the pier with <em>4 Visions</em> playing was even more of a trip. I think I&rsquo;m going to start carrying my Discman around more often.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided that there are a couple of things mobile Discman users need:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A Discman waist pack &ndash; While you want to avoid the &ldquo;fanny pack&rdquo; look at all costs, you can still get one of these that doesn&rsquo;t look quite so lame. A simple, slim, black waist pack is ideal.</p></li>
<li><p>A pair of headphones with volume slider &ndash; These things are divine. The ones I use not only have a single cable wire coming from the left earpiece (as opposed to one coming from each, forming an annoying little &ldquo;V&rdquo; around your neck), but it also has a volume slider further down on the cable. This way, when I want to adjust the volume of my music, I can just use this slider rather than fumble around with my waist pack. Hey, if you have to have a damn cable dangling in front of your chest, you might as well attach a practical use to it, right?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So anyway, later Saturday night, I returned to town. I spent a little more time in the arcade. I have gotten better at Ms. Pac Man than I ever expected I would. I just threw one quarter into the machine and played, and I got relatively close to the high score (of the day, at least). So I tossed another quarter in, and played some more. I beat that high score in the last second of Ms. Pac Man&rsquo;s life (I gobbled a 5000 point piece of fruit approximately 0.8 seconds before a ghost robbed Ms. Pac Man of the last of her already-too-brief lives). Still, victory! I raised the bar! After that, I headed down to the beach, with Ozric Tentacles&rsquo;s <em>Erpland</em> in the Discman.</p>

<p>Sunday was Zeuhl day. I listened to Xaal&rsquo;s <em>On The Way (En Chemin)</em> in the car on the way to the beach. This CD only cost me $6 from <a href="http://www.waysidemusic.com/limited.html">Wayside&rsquo;s limited stock</a> and has proven to be easily worth it. It&rsquo;s not the most well-mixed CD (the volume level seems to be universally too low, which did pose a problem when listening to it on my Discman &ndash; I had the volume maxed and it was still a bit too quiet), but it&rsquo;s a great album. I fully intend to get more Xaal, as this album has simply impressed the pants off of me. It&rsquo;s like the more jazz/fusiony moments of Magma, except less repetitive (note: Magma&rsquo;s use of repetition is for great dramatic effect, but it is nice that Xaal goes in a different direction rather than imitate Magma).</p>

<p>After lunch, I headed toward the pier. I yanked Xaal out of my Discman and threw in Koenjihyakkei&rsquo;s <em>Hundred Sights of Koenji</em>. Wow! The driving bass and powerful vocals made me want to kick somebody&rsquo;s ass. If I had sung the vocals out loud as I walked, I would have scared the shit out of everyone on that damn pier. Just imagine this 6&#8217;1&#8221;, 230 lb white boy, with the sides of his head shaved down fairly close to the skin, spikey hair on top (which is not altogether unintentional, but is actually just how my hair naturally acts when it&rsquo;s freshly cut short), chanting and shouting these deep unrecognizable vocals with an almost Nazi-esque fervor. They would think I&rsquo;m speaking in tongues (which, well, would be correct, as Koenjihyakkei&rsquo;s vocals appear to be in Kobaian, like Magma&rsquo;s). To fully understand what I&rsquo;m talking about, click this link to download <a href="http://www.vgpalace.com/media/Koenjihyakkei%20-%20(01">Koenjihyakkei &ndash; Ioss.mp3 (3:58, 3.82MB)</a> Ioss.mp3). You simply <em>have</em> to hear the pounding chorus of &ldquo;<strong>Ioss! Ioss! Ioss! Ioss!</strong>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As I started to leave the pier, who should appear but my best friend. Turns out he was staying in the area with some of our other friends. He was most likely checking out UC Santa Barbara, which I suspect he&rsquo;ll choose as his school. I talked with them for a little while, and then went to the arcade for some more Ms. Pac Man action (as well as some dual-gun, two-fisted-fury House of the Dead blasting). After that, I went to a thrift shop, looking for some used vinyls. There were some, but they were all crap (both in terms of the condition of the records, and the music stored on them). Ah well, it was time to head back home.</p>

<p>During the car ride home, I put Tortoise&rsquo;s <em>TNT</em> into the CD player. Ooh, it was wonderful. Especially the twangy &ldquo;I Set My Face To The Hillside&rdquo;, which came on as we past the Corcoran prison and drove through what amounted to little more than desert, a canal, and a single row of power lines.</p>

<p>When I got home, my copy of Mogwai&rsquo;s <em>Ten Rapid</em> was waiting in the mailbox. Outstanding. I threw all my gear into my room and plopped down in bed, as I was dead tired. I missed my first class this morning because I was unable to get myself up and around early enough.</p>

<p>On a different note, I have started thinking about a female friend of mine in something of a different light than before. While this friend has always been just a &ldquo;good ol&#8217;&rdquo; friend in the past, the idea of pursuing a closer relationship has been bouncing around in my head. It&rsquo;s strange&hellip; I&rsquo;ve never quite thought about her &ldquo;like that&rdquo; before. However, I have had a gut feeling that she wouldn&rsquo;t be totally repulsed by the idea of dating &ndash; I even have felt at times that she&rsquo;d say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; if I just asked her (whether this is enlightened intuition or a happy self-delusion is anyone&rsquo;s guess). Anyway, I&rsquo;m not completely sure about how I feel about the idea of dating her. I don&rsquo;t know if I could just walk up to her and ask her to dinner with these confused feelings. I do know that I need to talk to her and re-acquaint myself with her a bit (we don&rsquo;t have any classes together, so I only see her in passing). Perhaps talking to her will help clear up some of my confusion&hellip;</p>

<p>Back to music. Here&rsquo;s a list of the things I listened to this weekend:<br/>
Bozzio Levin Stevens &ndash; Black Light Syndrome<br/>
Supersister &ndash; Present From Nancy<br/>
After Crying &ndash; Megalázottak és Megszomorítottak<br/>
Labradford &ndash; Mi Media Naranja<br/>
Eskaton &ndash; 4 Visions<br/>
Low &ndash; Songs for a Dead Pilot EP<br/>
Isotope 217° &ndash; The Unstable Molecule<br/>
Xaal &ndash; On The Way (En Chemin)<br/>
Koenjihyakkei &ndash; Hundred Sights of Koenji<br/>
Magma &ndash; Mekanik Destructiw Kommandah<br/>
Ozric Tentacles &ndash; Erpland<br/>
Mogwai &ndash; EP+2<br/>
DFA &ndash; Duty Free Area<br/>
Happy The Man &ndash; Happy The Man<br/>
Tortoise &ndash; TNT</p>

<p>Well, I haven&rsquo;t proof-read this big post, and since it was written in sections rather than straight through from beginning to end, it&rsquo;s possible that something might not make sense. If that turns out to be the case, click the &ldquo;E-mail <em>Legion</em>&rdquo; link in the left menu and berate me for my errors.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Apparently being a little depressed over a girl wasn&rsquo;t enough. Deciding that I needed to be kicked while already down, CalPoly San Luis Obispo just sent me a wonderful little rejection letter. <em>sigh</em>&hellip; as I said to someone today, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s it like for someone to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to you? I&rsquo;ve forgotten.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>On a better note, Steve from <a href="http://www.cuneiformrecords.com">Wayside</a> posted a message at rec.music.progressive stating that he would be receiving 12 copies of Kultivator&rsquo;s <em>Barndomens Stigar</em> soon. I quickly emailed him and reserved a copy. The CD that I thought might take forever to get (see Tuesday, March 8th&rsquo;s log entry) has now fallen into my lap.</p>

<p>A small victory, though. This week could have gone a lot better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Digging through all those new vinyls and CDs that I bought. I just ordered 5 more CDs and an LP (thanks to a CDNow gift certificate birthday present and some good used stuff at Half.com).</p></blockquote>

<p>Soon to arrive in the mail:<br/>
Ange &ndash; Au-Dela Du Delire<br/>
Gentle Giant &ndash; Acquiring The Taste <br/>
Uz Jsme Doma &ndash; Ears<br/>
Mogwai &ndash; Ten Rapid<br/>
Ui &ndash; The Iron Apple EP<br/>
FM &ndash; Black Noise (used LP &ndash; 99 cents from Half.com)</p>

<p>Those first two CDs are among the top 100 rated albums at Gnosis (<a href="http://www.gnosis2000.net">http://www.gnosis2000.net</a>). I&rsquo;ll have the whole top 100 eventually (save the ones that are out-of-print). The Uz Jsme Doma is&hellip; I dunno. I&rsquo;ve heard good things about UJD, but I&rsquo;ve not heard them myself. But for $6.99, it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the praise. The Mogwai and Ui add to my building &ldquo;post-rock&rdquo; collection (which will be further bolstered with an order from Kranky and Constellation Records in the near future). And the FM is a prog album that I almost bought the CD of from CDNow (but the general consensus opinion is that it&rsquo;s not as good as the other things I bought). When I stumbled onto the vinyl for 99 cents at Half.com, I was quite glad I didn&rsquo;t buy the CD.</p>

<p>Playlist:<br/>
Brand X &ndash; Product<br/>
King Crimson &ndash; Lizard<br/>
Kansas &ndash; Song For America<br/>
Jethro Tull &ndash; Aqualung<br/>
PFM &ndash; Cook<br/>
Höstsonaten &ndash; Mirrorgames<br/>
Fly Pan Am &ndash; Fly Pan Am</p>

<p>Höstsonaten is such a flirt. The album keeps acting like it&rsquo;s going to be really good, and then stumbles a bit. It&rsquo;s a little frustrating because it <em>could</em> be so much better. Höstsonaten is a side-project of Finisterre&rsquo;s, so maybe I should look info Finisterre. A couple of their albums are supposed to be really good.</p>

<p><em>Fly Pan Am</em> will probably be included in my Constellation order (which I&rsquo;ll likely make later this week). I need to listen to the MP3s more, but it seems pretty good. One track goes on for entirely too long, though (I believe the third, which eclipses 17 minutes despite not having quite enough interesting material to sustain that long period of time).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s weird listening to PFM in English (on <em>Cook</em>, a live album recorded from US/Canada shows in 1974). I much prefer them in their native Italian. I&rsquo;ve avoided &ldquo;English versions&rdquo; of Italian albums, due to the overriding consensus that these albums are typically inferior to their native Italian counterparts (and due to the fact that I have no ridiculous &ldquo;must be in English!&rdquo; bias). In fact, that brings us back to the Höstsonaten album, which is sung in English (Finisterre usually sings in Italian). The vocals are OK most of the time, but there are those moments when it&rsquo;s clear that these guys aren&rsquo;t native English speakers. Those moments are annoying and detract from the overall listening experience. The fact that the Finisterre albums aren&rsquo;t in English (and thus avoids one of <em>Mirrorgames</em>&rsquo;s pitfalls) is further motivation to pick one up.</p>

<p>Brand X is interesting. When I first became a progrock fan, it was a shock to learn that Phil Collins (<em>the</em> Phil Collins) used to play in a band like Genesis (and I mean the &lsquo;70s art-rock version with Peter Gabriel on vocals, not the &#8217;80s/&#8217;90s pop band that mirrored Collins&rsquo;s solo career). It&rsquo;s even more shocking to hear Collins in Brand X, a fusion (jazz-rock) band. This is even less related to &ldquo;pop&rdquo; than Genesis (which still turned out a few singles despite not focusing on that sort of pursuit). It&rsquo;s a pretty decent album, despite being only the 5th highest rated (out of 9) at Gnosis. I hear that some of their earlier material smokes, so I&rsquo;ll keep an eye out for those. I think I might have seen a different Brand X LP at the store I bought this one from. I&rsquo;ll look closely for that next time.</p>
