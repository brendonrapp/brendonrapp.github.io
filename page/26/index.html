  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>ARGH! Someone was selling Area&rsquo;s <em>Crac!</em> on rec.music.progressive, but another buyer got to it before I could. (insert vulgar explitives here!!).</p></blockquote>

<p>I <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t want to pay $18 for a 38 minute album, but I may have to (heck, I should consider myself lucky &ndash; a few months ago, it wasn&rsquo;t available at all! I tried to buy it for $18 before but the dealer couldn&rsquo;t fill the order).</p>

<p>Scored some Japanese avant-rock goodness, in the form of Tipographica and Bondage Fruit&rsquo;s self-titled debut albums. $20 a pop. Crikey. I also have Koenjihyakkei&rsquo;s <em>II</em> reserved at Wayside for the same price. Damn those Japanese taxes&hellip; I&rsquo;m tired of paying $20 for a CD, but no domestic label is going to release the material. It&rsquo;s not the vendor&rsquo;s faults, since they have to pay the high price to get the CD, and that has to be passed onto the consumer (especially when you&rsquo;re talking about low-margin specialty retailers like Wayside &ndash; God bless you, Steve Feigenbaum).</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m cruising the BMG catalog to load up on some more jazz albums, as well as classical. I&rsquo;m strongly thinking of declaring January to be &ldquo;Jazz Month&rdquo;, and listen to almost only jazz albums. At the very least, I will have a &ldquo;Jazz Week&rdquo;, and perhaps a &ldquo;Jazz Two Weeks&rdquo;. Thing is, I could spend days just on the Miles Davis <em>Complete Bitches Brew Sessions</em> and the John Coltrane <em>Complete Village Vanguard Recordings</em> boxes themselves.</p>

<p>I was at Borders a couple of days ago, and listened to a performance of Rimsky-Korsakov&rsquo;s <em>Scheherazade</em> on one of the listening stations. In particular, the second movement (I forget the name) was great. I will be getting a CD of that piece from BMG (I&rsquo;ve been cross-referencing the performances on the BMG CDs with comments at rec.music.classical.recordings, in order to separate the gems from the crappy ones&hellip; up until now, I&rsquo;ve tried to get into classical by buying the cheapy CDs, but have failed to enjoy them &ndash; they tend to sound like they were recorded in broom closets). Especially when it comes to classical music, quality matters.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s been about half a month since I last wrote something here. Hmmph.</p></blockquote>

<p>What&rsquo;s happened in the meantime? Well, I am diving head-first into the realm of electronic music. I picked up what is apparently an &ldquo;ambient house&rdquo; classic, Global Communication&rsquo;s <em>76:14</em>. This sucker&rsquo;s great. It finds a middle ground between Steve Roach-style ambience and modern electronica (not unlike the middle ground post-rock (at least the &ldquo;drone-rock&rdquo; contingent) often establishes between ambient and rock). I do enjoy Steve Roach, but ambient with a stronger rhythmic presence tends to have a stronger effect on me.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s starting to seem that space/ambient music has the potential to be even more near and dear to me than more &ldquo;busy&rdquo; styles of music like jazz or prog-rock. I guess it shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising, given that the space rock bits in Pink Floyd are my favorite moments from that band&rsquo;s canon of music.</p>

<p>This new direction will eventually push me to the borders of both techno and New Age. At some point, I expect to eventually encounter stuff in those realms that repulses me &ndash; thus establishing the borders of where my tastes in this field run. What remains to be seen is whether these borders exist on the outskirts of these genres, or whether they&rsquo;re well into the heart of the genres (or perhaps the borders don&rsquo;t exist at all &ndash; in which case, Present and YETI can expect to be joined by Prodigy and Yanni in my CD case soon).</p>

<p>Oh, and the new Mogwai EP is good. Not quite <em>Rock Action</em> good or <em>EP+2</em> good, but it&rsquo;s <em>Young Team</em> good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Last night, I went on a quest: find a used copy of a Loreena McKennitt album (preferably <em>The Mask and Mirror</em>, but any of her three final full-length releases would have been acceptable). Three record stores later, I came home with no McKennitt in hand. I did come close to buying the new Mogwai EP, but I wasn&rsquo;t ready to drop $8 on a 20 minute EP without hearing it &ndash; even though the band&rsquo;s most recent album, <em>Rock Action</em>, has recently become my favorite release of theirs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon arriving at home, I ended up firing up <a href="http://www.bearshare.com/">BearShare</a> (which has replaced Morpheus as the first music client I go to for fairly &ldquo;popular&rdquo; music, and is second only to AudioGalaxy for overall use) and downloaded the various individual tracks that comprise <em>The Mask and Mirror</em>. Listening to it right now&hellip; while I find myself wishing for a warmer, less &ldquo;overt&rdquo; mix (i.e. not having vocals or the main instrumental melody slap you in the face and overpower the rest of the music), I do like what I hear, and will continue trying to find any of her last three albums in the used bins (I sure found a lot of Brian McKnight when I was looking&hellip; sheesh).</p>

<p>Music moment for the day: Sitting in a chair at the Health Center at the university, Discman headphones on, waiting for the results of some blood work from the lab, listening to Tarentel&rsquo;s <em>The Order of Things</em> (specifically, &ldquo;Ghosty Head&rdquo;, a Rickie Lee James cover) while reading the college newspaper&rsquo;s story about the rape awareness rally a couple of nights ago, and some of the stories retold there. The song in question is a quiet, piano and (very soft) female vocals piece. When listening to the song last night while driving, it seemed beautiful. When listening in the doctor&rsquo;s office while reading that newspaper story, it seemed chilling, frightening. The vocals, which had seemed so pretty before, seemed woundedly brooding this time. While it may not be Tori Amos&#8217; &ldquo;Me and a Gun&rdquo;, it sure was close. It invoked the same mood and feeling, at least at that moment in time. What remains to be seen is if the song will go back to sounding &ldquo;pretty&rdquo;, or if it will remain locked in the context of today&rsquo;s listen.</p>

<p>On a more upbeat note, I have continued my exercise routine to the letter. Not a single day&rsquo;s ride has been missed. As a result, I have lost 15 pounds since starting the exercise routine (which, when added to the 10 that I lost before starting, brings me to a total of 25 pounds lost since moving away from my hometown). I took an old bathroom scale from my parents&#8217; house, and have been tracking my weight daily. It sure is encouraging to see the number go down every few days.</p>

<p>Currently downloading the new Mogwai EP. Will give it a chance to earn an $8 purchase. If it can manage to be as good as <em>EP+2</em> or the most recent full-length album <em>Rock Action</em>, then I will not hesitate to grab it.</p>

<p>Also discovered a new band from AudioGalaxy downloads, Halifax Pier. Yet another band on the Temporary Residence label. I&rsquo;m going to have to start checking out artists specifically because they&rsquo;re on that label, because I keep finding cool new &ldquo;post-rock&rdquo; and other bands that are on TR.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>_Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn?</p></blockquote>

<p>Remember how she said that we would meet again&hellip;._</p>

<p>Why the Pink Floyd reference? Err, I dunno. The only Floyd albums I&rsquo;ve listened to in the last few months have been <em>Atom Heart Mother</em> and <em>Obscured By Clouds</em>, neither of which contain the song that the above is taken from (that&rsquo;s from <em>The Wall</em>). This is just a random lyric that appeared in my head.</p>

<p>Listened to Tortoise&rsquo;s <em>Standards</em>, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso&rsquo;s <em>Io Sono Nato Libero</em>, Sigur Rós&rsquo;s <em>Ágætis Byrjun</em>, and Cul de Sac&rsquo;s <em>Ecim</em>. The Tortoise, Banco, and Sigur Rós are all known quantities to me. The Cul de Sac was a bit new. It&rsquo;s a CD I&rsquo;ve had for a while, but have only listened to once. Second impressions? Good but very uneven. There are great moments of Krautrock-influenced stuff, but other parts are lame or annoying (couple songs with painful vocals). Their most recent album, <em>Crashes to Light, Minutes to Its Fall</em> is much better &ndash; at least, that&rsquo;s my opinion, based on my one listen to it and my two listens to <em>Ecim</em>. Cul de Sac certainly deserves some more listens, that&rsquo;s for sure&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Drove down to my parents&#8217; house today (since everyone came up to visit me, it was time for me to head down there m&#8217;self). Took a stack of CDs, as usual. Among them was Hands <em>Palm Mystery</em>. I didn&rsquo;t get into this the first time I heard it, so I wanted to give it another shot. The verdict? Errrrmm&hellip;&hellip; still not really digging it. I understand that their self-titled 2nd album is better. Still, this one seems just like the Yezda Urfa that I recently acquired (<em>Sacred Baboon</em>)&hellip; they just aren&rsquo;t appealing to me very much. Is symphonic rock losing it&rsquo;s grip on me? Good instrumental symph still appeals to me much (like Pulsar&rsquo;s <em>Halloween</em> and Shylock&rsquo;s <em>Ile de Fievre</em>). But stuff with vocals is failing to grab me, outside of some of the faves like Gentle Giant. Classic Italian symph seems to be exempt from this, but newer stuff (like La Torre dell&#8217;Alchimista) does not.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s run a counter. It basically started when the Yezda Urfa failed to &ldquo;0wn&rdquo; me when I first listened to it, one week ago. Sooooo&hellip; it has been <strong>7</strong> days since a new-to-me, non-instrumental, non-fave, non-classic-Italian symphonic rock album has &ldquo;0wned&rdquo; me. Let&rsquo;s see what album manages to break this funk.</p>

<p>Of the other CDs that made the drive with me, Henry Cow <em>Leg End (original mix)</em>, Ui <em>The Iron Apple EP</em>, and Weidorje&rsquo;s self-titled all were pleasing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p><em>What should we do today?</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Listened to Tortoise&rsquo;s <em>TNT</em> on the way to work/school today. Haven&rsquo;t dug that out in a while, but it re-affirmed why it is still my favorite Tortoise disc.</p>

<p>Later, after classes, I drove around running a few errands, and had Miles Davis&rsquo;s <em>Bitches Brew</em> in the CD player. Actually, the <em>Complete Bitches Brew Sessions</em>, CD #1. You know, I might end up buying the regular 2CD version of that album, despite having the 4CD box set. It&rsquo;s great music to listen to while driving (good jazz/fusion tends to be), but the box packaging is not very convienent for the car. Same with Magma&rsquo;s <em>Trilogie Au Trianon</em> &ndash; despite being a compact box, it&rsquo;s still not convienent. I like jewel cases because I can open them up, take the CD out, and put the CD into my car stereo without ever taking my eyes off the road. And here&rsquo;s a safe driving trick: when you have a bunch of CDs in the car and need to find a certain one, just grab one and hold it up next to your view of the road, and glance at it. You can see what it is, and not take your eyes off the road for any longer than you do to glance at your rear-view mirrors and such. If it&rsquo;s not the right one, then put it down and grab the next one. Might take a few tries, but it&rsquo;s MUCH safer than looking down and digging through them and not paying attention to the road. Don&rsquo;t hit me with your car!</p>

<p>Anyway, after all that, I went home. I was tired, and the couch looked inviting. I took this opportunity to listen to Tarantel&rsquo;s <em>From Bone To Satellite</em>. I need to get my booty up to San Francisco and see these guys play live. I missed an opportunity to see them and Zoviet*France (and meet a friend from rec.music.progressive) because my job started that week. But Tarantel is located in SF, so I should get a chance to see them. I wasn&rsquo;t seeing anything while listening to <em>From Bone To Satellite</em>, though, as I dozed off on the couch. When I awoke, I looked at the clock and noticed that my Physics class had already started. Whoops. Oh well, it wasn&rsquo;t an important day of class, so no big deal.</p>

<p>After swinging by my boss&rsquo;s house to pick up her computer (doing some maintenance work on it), I went driving around town. I had Fates Warning&rsquo;s <em>A Pleasant Shade of Gray</em> in the car stereo. Damn, but that&rsquo;s a hell of an album. It&rsquo;s one of the indispensable discs in my collection. I didn&rsquo;t much like it when I first got it, but back then, my notion of &ldquo;prog&rdquo; was musical gymnastics a la Dream Theater. Over time, that perception eroded, and the Fates Warning disc was given it&rsquo;s chance to shine. I think I may have told this story here before, but too bad. You get to read it again.</p>

<p>So, while driving in town, listening to Fates, I stopped at Tower Records. I was distraught when I noticed that not even Tortoise were in their &ldquo;rock&rdquo; section. I tend to judge music stores by their &ldquo;indie&rdquo; stock (after all, you can get Fleetwood Mac CDs anywhere). Well, after not seeing anything at all, I started looking for the jazz section. Maybe they at least had the Art Blakey album I want. Well, I looked and looked, and did not find a jazz section anywhere (despite a number of jazz artists, like Louis Armstrong, appearing in the budget bins). While searching, however, I found an &ldquo;indie&rdquo; section to the store. And what do you know, there was the Tortoise and Mogwai, and more. The Sea and Cake, Tarantel, even some prog-metal (Therion, Symphony X, and Zero Hour) were there. Woo! Also some electronic artists like Isis. Lots of San Francisco indie band lovin&#8217; (like Tarantel and Neurosis, but no Sleepytime Gorilla Museum&hellip; <em>sigh</em>). The sections were divided up by genre (rock, industrial, spacerock, metal, etc.) Well, I grabbed the Tarantel (their new album, <em>The Order of Things</em>) as well as a copy of Wire magazine (with the Japanese psych-rock band that I just read about at Pitchfork and downloaded an album of &ndash; Acid Mothers Temple). I&rsquo;ve wanted to read an issue of Wire for a while now, and since their cover story is a band that I am very freshly interested in, now seemed as good of a time as any.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m home now, listening to Tarantel and opening up the Wire mag.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>I live!</p></blockquote>

<p>Damn, it&rsquo;s been a month! My approximately tri-weekly posts disappeared for a full month. Why is that, you ask? Well, pretty much for the same reasons as last month&rsquo;s post: moving, becoming acquainted with a new city, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Odd musical obsession for the week: Spiral Architect&rsquo;s <em>A Sceptic&rsquo;s Universe</em> has continuously found it&rsquo;s way into my various CD players after months of absence. As someone that doesn&rsquo;t much care for metal (prog or otherwise), it&rsquo;s odd to enjoy an album like this one as much as I do. Things that would normally bother me, like the lead singer&rsquo;s occasional (well, maybe a little more regular than occasional) screetches and howls, don&rsquo;t really phase me on this record. The mixing job on this album is something that I specifically like. The bass is mixed up-front and cleanly, and thus doesn&rsquo;t get lost behind the rhythm guitar wall-of-sound (something that seems to happen on a number of metal albums &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know the last time that I specifically heard John Myung in a non-bass-solo part). Maybe the bass up-front mixing would be considered amateurish by some seasoned studio wizards. All I can say for sure is that <em>I</em> find it preferable to the more typical &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the bass? It&rsquo;s in there!&rdquo; metal productions.</p>

<p>I can not sing. However, that never seems to stop me from trying.</p>

<p>King Crimson&rsquo;s <em>The Nightwatch</em> 2CD live set has been a regular in my stereos as well. I sure do enjoy a lot of the <em>Starless &amp; Bible Black</em> material sans-overdubs.</p>

<p>I want a cello. Maybe when I find a job and begin earning some money, I might buy myself one.</p>

<p>Everyone&rsquo;s copy of NHL 2001 should have the Alamaailman Vasarat &ldquo;dittie&rdquo; that I have customized in my own. Only in my virtual NHL arenas can one hear Vasarat, Ratt, Birdsongs of the Mesozoic, Whitesnake, Kenso, Quiet Riot, Deus Ex Machina, and Night Ranger in the span of a few minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Motoring! What&rsquo;s your price for flight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If I were granted only one wish from a magic genie, I would use it to secure my financial future for life and for the lives of my future offspring (and their reproductive achievements, and so on). But if I had TWO wishes, I would use the second one to get a lock of Steve Wilson&rsquo;s hair!</p>

<p>I bought the new remaster of <em>Leftoverture</em> by Kansas. The quality is good, but the disc raises a complaint about the inclusion of bonus tracks. Now, while I am usually a strong &ldquo;bonus track advocate&rdquo;, the two lackluster live tunes that have been grafted to the end of this rather nice album really rub me the wrong way. I mean, they bite. The vocal performances bring tears of pain to my eyes, and the eyes of anyone within earshot. Certainly not all live Kansas could have been this poor? Surely someone has soundboard tapes of really good performances locked away somewhere. These selections sound as if those responsible for the CD&rsquo;s production just grabbed the nearest Kansas live tape and ran with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cum on feel the noize! Girls rock your boyz!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;vox estote Vos: principes muti eae com sint, leges vos loquentes. Eis ex principiis perpetuis omnes homimum easus et actiones dirigenda!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was going to type more, but NHL 2001 calls to me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>These last couple of weeks, pursuing young women has taken a back-seat (no pun intended!) to a score of more pressing concerns. To be precise, I now have a university to transfer to (California State University, Fresno), an apartment (a 1-bedroom loft about two minutes away from CSUF, which I will be completely moved into after finishing my finals next week), and the ever-nearing end of my 4th and final semester at Porterville. After I finish moving and dealing with all of that crap, I will resume my regularly scheduled getting-shot-down-repeatedly. :)</p></blockquote>

<p>Some new music bits:</p>

<p>King Crimson&rsquo;s <em>Heavy ConstruKction</em> is surprisingly good. I picked up a copy after some of the #progrock chatters insisted that it was a strong release. It&rsquo;s a 3CD live set, with the 3rd CD consisting entirely of improvs. Good stuff.</p>

<p>Tortoise&rsquo;s <em>Standards</em> and Mogwai&rsquo;s <em>Rock Action</em> have grown on me quite a bit. I was pleasantly surprised to see both of these CDs featured at Borders. The Borders mini-blurb called <em>Standards</em> &ldquo;&hellip; perhaps their most accessible offering to date&rdquo;, which I had to chuckle at, because it strikes me as being rather inaccessible compared to <em>TNT</em> or <em>Millions Now Living Will Never Die</em>. Not that I would call <em>Standards</em> &ldquo;inaccessible&rdquo; on it&rsquo;s own, but as it relates to those two, yeah.</p>

<p>Magma&rsquo;s <em>Theusz Hamtaahk</em> box set is a wonderful little package. I must shamefully admit that I don&rsquo;t own the studio <em>Wurdah Itah</em>, nor do I have <em>Retrospectiw I-II</em> for the first released performance of &ldquo;Theusz Hamtaahk&rdquo;. I do, however, have <em>Mekanik Destructiw Kommandah</em>. The version from this box set seems to have rather weak brass hits, but the drumming is sufficiently powerful.</p>

<p>NeBeLNeST&rsquo;s self-titled album really does something for me. I guess I just have a thing for spacey jams, but a lot of bands in that vein fail to do it for me. Needless to say, I eagerly, eagerly, eagerly await NeBeLNeST&rsquo;s Bob Drake-produced sophomore effort.</p>

<p>Iona&rsquo;s <em>Journey Into The Morn</em>&hellip;. got it from BMG&hellip; y&#8217;know, I like this album a lot more than I ought to. I probably should hate it. But instead, I&rsquo;ve walked around for entire days, singing &ldquo;WiiiiiiiIIIIIIIiiiissdom!&rdquo; to myself&hellip; (God descends over Legion, looks down, laughs, and shouts &ldquo;All your soul are belong to me!&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Some recent grabs that I haven&rsquo;t listen much to yet:</p>

<p>Thinking Plague &ndash; <em>Early Plague Years</em></p>

<p>King Crimson &ndash; <em>Epitaph (2 CD)</em></p>

<p>The Science Group &ndash; <em>A Mere Coincidence</em></p>

<p>&hellip; and about 5 more I can&rsquo;t think of right now. Right now, my room is a mess of boxes, papers, and more boxes (as mentioned above, I&rsquo;m moving into my own apartment in Fresno, so I&rsquo;m packing and moving most of my stuff now, and then will only have to move a few things after finals).</p>

<p>&ldquo;WiiiiiiiIIIIIIIiiiissdom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An interesting side note: a group of us at rec.music.progressive have decided to start a prog concert bootlegs group. Basically, we&rsquo;re going to work with some serious prog show tape collectors, and transfer their tapes to CDR (cleaning them up in the process), and then distribute the CDRs among our group (as well as to the tape collectors). Anyone interested in possibly participating is urged to e-mail me (see &ldquo;E-mail <em>Legion</em>&rdquo; link to the left). We&rsquo;re setting it up so people without tape transfer or CD burning equipment can still participate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>This week has, for the most part, sucked. Of course, every week leading up to the end of a semester sucks. It&rsquo;s just straining, that&rsquo;s all. Anthropology test, Psychology paper, Creative Writing story, and Calculus. Not fun.</p></blockquote>

<p>Music, however, has been great this week. I really &ldquo;clicked&rdquo; with Birdsongs of the Mesozoic&rsquo;s <em>Petrophonics</em>, Godspeed You Black Emperor!&rsquo;s <em>f#a#(infinity)</em>, and Supersister&rsquo;s <em>Present From Nancy</em> this week. I had liked each of them prior to this week, but they each took on a new and higher meaning after being listened to this week.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been downloading a lot of bootleg MP3s. Jaco Pastorius, Dream Theater, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Do Make Say Think, National Health, Miriodor, and A Silver Mt. Zion live bootlegs all now reside on my PC (soon to be archived to CD-R).</p>

<p>Currently listening to Magma&rsquo;s <em>Mekanik Destructiw Kommandah</em>. TOO COOL.</p>

<p>I bought five classical compilation CDs today. I wasn&rsquo;t looking to, but Wal-Mart had the audacity to sell them for only $1.96. One of them is a Tchaikovsky comp, one&rsquo;s a Beethoven comp, one&rsquo;s a Mozart comp, and the other two are piano comps with material from varying composers. I&rsquo;ll most likely replace them as soon as I become a &ldquo;serious&rdquo; classical collector, but they&rsquo;re welcome for now.</p>

<p>As for the girl mentioned last week&hellip; I&rsquo;m thinking about biting the bullet and calling her up tomorrow&hellip;..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Been a while since I&rsquo;ve posted. I&rsquo;ve been on Spring Break, although I haven&rsquo;t gone anywhere. Rather, I have been catching up on some much-needed rest. By the week before break, I was pretty constantly fatigued. I&rsquo;m feeling a bit better, and am ready to finish up the semester.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see, new CDs&hellip; oh yes:</p>

<p>The Who &ndash; Who&rsquo;s Next<br/>
David Tohir and his Backbone &ndash; Angels Dancing in Virga<br/>
Deus Ex Machina &ndash; Equilibrismo da Insofferenza<br/>
NeBeLNeST &ndash; NeBeLNeST<br/>
Charles Mingus &ndash; Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus<br/>
Chick Corea and Return to Forever &ndash; Light as a Feather<br/>
Ornette Coleman &ndash; The Shape of Jazz to Come</p>

<p>I have barely listened to these. You see, for the next week or so, I am instating a policy of only listening to MP3s when at home. I download so much, but a lot of it just sits there. So, for the time being, I am going to listen to MP3s when at home, and CDs when in the car and on foot.</p>

<p>Today, when sitting outside at a shopping center, I was drinking a Coke and listening to the radio that was being played for the seating area. The music mix was interesting. There was some pop, naturally, but then a Steely Dan tune played, and I didn&rsquo;t recognize which one. Furthermore, after that song, a Pink Floyd song played. That in itself was pretty interesting, but what caught my attention was the particular song. It wasn&rsquo;t one of the hits from <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em>, <em>The Wall</em>, <em>Wish You Were Here</em>, or even <em>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</em> or <em>The Division Bell</em>. I was able to identify the song as being something on <em>Meddle</em>, of all albums. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out which one (until I got home, and found out that it was &ldquo;San Tropaz&rdquo;). <em>Very</em> interesting choice.</p>
