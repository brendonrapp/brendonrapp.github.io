  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Interestingly, I&rsquo;ve been in more of a music buying mode than a music listening mode over the last couple of weeks. Last night, however, something &ldquo;clicked&rdquo; back into place, and I was enjoying my hobby much more than I have recently. I attribute this to a few things:</p></blockquote>

<p>(1) Bought a new pair of headphones. They&rsquo;re Koss TD-61&rsquo;s. Not audiophile by any stretch, but they are light, yet still the padded ear-encapsulating style. I have a pair of Sony&rsquo;s that sound great but are uncomfortable as hell. These Koss &lsquo;phones are about as good as you can ask a $20 pair of headphones to sound (and more so, if you ask me).</p>

<p>(2) Slowing down on the music acquiring and revisiting some old albums. My escapades into electronica, jazz, and so forth have been exciting and intriguing, but taking a break to take in some more good ol&#8217; post-rock, while also checking out a little bit of newer post-rock, has done me good.</p>

<p>(3) Jim Mora.  Just by being alive and on TV, Jim Mora makes me feel better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>My CD collection has grown quite a bit. Between Christmas, some vacation pillaging, and just some purchases on my own, I have lots of new music to listen to.</p></blockquote>

<p>Christmas gifts:</p>

<p>Beatles &ndash; <em>Revolver</em>: Pretty darn good. A few duff tracks (&ldquo;Yellow Submarine&rdquo; is blah, and &ldquo;Good Day Sunshine&rdquo; can go as well), but some great stuff as well.</p>

<p>Stravinsky &ndash; <em>&ldquo;Stravinsky&rdquo; (3CD set, SFSO w/Michael Tilson Thomas conducting)</em>: Haven&rsquo;t yet listened to this, but it was at the top of my Christmas CDs list. Spposedly a breathtaking recording of some great performances of three Stravinsky pieces. Grammy-award winning recording, and I&rsquo;ve heard that it was actually deserving of awards (you never know with the Grammy&rsquo;s these days, but the non-commercial awards appear less tainted than the headlining ones).</p>

<p>Radiohead &ndash; <em>Amnesiac</em>: Have had a CD-R made from MP3s up to this point. Asked for a real copy to replace it with. Got one.</p>

<p>McCoy Tyner &ndash; <em>The Real McCoy</em>: A jazz album that I wanted that BMG doesn&rsquo;t have.</p>

<hr />

<p>Stuff I bought on vacation (all used CDs):</p>

<p>Yes &ndash; <em>Magnification</em>: Wasn&rsquo;t looking to buy this, but when I saw a copy in the used bin, I couldn&rsquo;t resist.</p>

<p>Mr. Bungle &ndash; <em>California</em>: I haven&rsquo;t even listened to <em>Disco Volant√©</em> enough, but I have heard that this album is great, so I went ahead and got it.</p>

<p>Hawkwind &ndash; <em>This Is Hawkwind Do Not Panic</em>: My favorite album title of all time. Don&rsquo;t know how much I like Hawkwind yet, but it was cheap.</p>

<p>King Crimson &ndash; <em>Thrak</em>: A decent album that I&rsquo;ve had as MP3s up until now, decided a real copy was worth having.</p>

<hr />

<p>10 cent CDs (yes, the record store I was at had a bin of used CDs that each cost 10 cents):</p>

<p>Stone Temple Pilots &ndash; <em>Purple</em>: I was glad to see this in the 10 cent bin. I had a copy a long time ago, but gave it to a friend. Glad to have one back, for so cheap. The hit songs are definitely the best material on here.</p>

<p>Econoline Crush &ndash; <em>The Devil You Know</em>: The music computer at the store listed them as &ldquo;industrial pop&rdquo; or &ldquo;industrial metal&rdquo;. Any time I see &ldquo;industrial&rdquo;, I am intrigued. For 10 cents, it seemed like something to grab.</p>

<p>Jewel &ndash; <em>Spirit</em>: Because, well, you never know when I&rsquo;ll have a girl over at my apartment that likes Jewel. Though I&rsquo;m bummed there wasn&rsquo;t any Lisa Loeb there instead&hellip;.</p>

<p>Second Coming &ndash; <em>Second Coming</em>: Well, the cover looked kinda cool. Listened to one song while on vacation, and was instantly reminded of Alice in Chains. Come home, look at AllMusic, and wouldn&rsquo;t ya know, the name &ldquo;Alice in Chains&rdquo; is mentioned everywhere in the band&rsquo;s info. :)  Hey, an AiC ripoff isn&rsquo;t the worst thing in the world. Worth 10 cents.</p>

<p>Juliana Hatfield &ndash; <em>Juliana&rsquo;s Pony: Total System Failure</em>: Not sure why I grabbed this one. Seen her name tossed around here and there.</p>

<p>Jesus Lizard &ndash; <em>Blue</em>: Who can resist noise-rock? Not me! Unfortunately, this isn&rsquo;t one of JL&rsquo;s &ldquo;classic&rdquo; albums, but is still supposed to be good.</p>

<p>Tal Bachman &ndash; <em>Tal Bachman</em>: Yes, of Bachman Turner Overdrive fame! Well, actually, the son of Randy Bachman. This is basically a &lsquo;70s-style pop album with Hammond B3 and Moog on it. For 10 cents, I&rsquo;ll take anything with a Hammond, even if it&rsquo;s just to hear how bad it is (this is supposed to be OK though). I&rsquo;m not expecting greatness, so I won&rsquo;t be disappointed. :)</p>

<hr />

<hr />

<p>Post-Christmas gift certificate purchases:</p>

<p>Autechre &ndash; <em>Tri Repetae++</em>: I&rsquo;m getting into interesting electronic artists.</p>

<p>Future Sound of London &ndash; <em>ISDN</em>: See above. This one actually features a little Robert Fripp too! :)</p>

<p>Robert Rich &ndash; <em>Trances/Drones</em>: One of the pioneering ambient artists, and this is his classic two complementary albums (now sold together as a single 2CD set).</p>

<p>Penderecki &ndash; <em>Orchestral Works</em>: A good recording of some of the best work of this 20th century composer.</p>

<p>Post-Christmas money purchases:</p>

<p>Tool &ndash; <em>√Ünima</em>: I needed a CD copy of this!</p>

<p>Queensr√øche &ndash; <em>Operation: Mindcrime</em>: I was planning on getting this as a BMG selection, but when I saw it for $9.99 at Best Buy, I decided to just buy it and use the BMG selection on something that I can&rsquo;t get so cheaply.</p>

<p>mu-Ziq &ndash; <em>Royal Astronomy</em>: See Autechre &amp; FSOL above.</p>

<p>I still have over $80 left of Borders credit, so there will be more to come. Trying to decide if I should have them order some stuff for me (I want Orbital&rsquo;s <em>In Sides</em>! And maybe some Acid Mothers Temple).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Stuff I&rsquo;ve been listening to lately:</p></blockquote>

<p>Dream Theater &ndash; <em>Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence</em>: DT&rsquo;s new album isn&rsquo;t officially out yet, but has been leaked to various newsgroups and places like AudioGalaxy. I&rsquo;ve downloaded a copy and have listened to it a few times. A few songs, like &ldquo;Misunderstood&rdquo;, have made an impact, but for the most part, it&rsquo;s been pretty yawn-inducing. It&rsquo;s a two-disc album, and the entire second disc is one 40 minute title track suite. So far, it&rsquo;s pretty boring. :(</p>

<p>Yes &ndash; <em>Magnification</em>: Here&rsquo;s another boring album. I don&rsquo;t much want to talk about it (let&rsquo;s put it this way &ndash; I&rsquo;ve only made it to the end of the album once so far). I will say, though, that anyone that wants to hear what strings and horns in a prog-rock band can sound like when done WELL needs to hear Townscream&rsquo;s <em>Nagyv√°rosi Ikonok</em>.</p>

<p>Fates Warning &ndash; <em>Disconnected</em>: Surprisingly good. I liked <em>A Pleasant Shade of Gray</em>, of course. This one&rsquo;s different &ndash; a bit faster and louder. But it&rsquo;s still outstanding. Descriptions like &ldquo;a less-dark Tool&rdquo; would not be too far off the mark.</p>

<p>Dream Theater &ndash; <em>When Dream and Day Unite</em>: A naive, charming album. I actually like Charlie Dominici&rsquo;s &ldquo;mini-Geddy&rdquo; vocals. And while the whole band look like dorks in their pictures on the back of the CD, there&rsquo;s some cool tunes here. &ldquo;Ytse Jam&rdquo; is nice, of course, but &ldquo;Status Seeker&rdquo; kicks as well. Not a great album, but a decent one, and it&rsquo;s fun to listen to sometimes.</p>

<p>Halifax Pier &ndash; <em>The Halifax Pier</em>: Oy. I&rsquo;ve been saying that Global Communication&rsquo;s <em>76:14</em> is the best CD I&rsquo;ve bought this year, but maybe this one is. Violin, cello, and dual guitars create sweet, depressing soundscapes. Me likey.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve mentioned it here before, but a few months ago, I instituted a personal policy in my music listening, where I acted on any musical impulse without question. What this means is, if I think I want to listen to something, I do so immediately. Now, listening to what you want to listen to may not seem like something all that notable, or even unusual. But what I&rsquo;m talking about is on a more impulsive level. Like, if I get a song in my head, I will listen to it, regardless of what the song is. For example, Journey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Separate Ways&rdquo; and Bon Jovi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Living on a Prayer&rdquo; have both burned their way into my skull in recent weeks. As a result, I downloaded them, and listened to them numerous times. If, for some reason, I feel like listening to a Whitney Houston song, I reach for my Pop MP3s CDR and toss it into my computer, no questions asked.</p></blockquote>

<p>I had more to say, but it has long been forgotten, as I have (a) a Calculus test to study for, and (b) the LA Kings game is now on my TV.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>ARGH! Someone was selling Area&rsquo;s <em>Crac!</em> on rec.music.progressive, but another buyer got to it before I could. (insert vulgar explitives here!!).</p></blockquote>

<p>I <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t want to pay $18 for a 38 minute album, but I may have to (heck, I should consider myself lucky &ndash; a few months ago, it wasn&rsquo;t available at all! I tried to buy it for $18 before but the dealer couldn&rsquo;t fill the order).</p>

<p>Scored some Japanese avant-rock goodness, in the form of Tipographica and Bondage Fruit&rsquo;s self-titled debut albums. $20 a pop. Crikey. I also have Koenjihyakkei&rsquo;s <em>II</em> reserved at Wayside for the same price. Damn those Japanese taxes&hellip; I&rsquo;m tired of paying $20 for a CD, but no domestic label is going to release the material. It&rsquo;s not the vendor&rsquo;s faults, since they have to pay the high price to get the CD, and that has to be passed onto the consumer (especially when you&rsquo;re talking about low-margin specialty retailers like Wayside &ndash; God bless you, Steve Feigenbaum).</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m cruising the BMG catalog to load up on some more jazz albums, as well as classical. I&rsquo;m strongly thinking of declaring January to be &ldquo;Jazz Month&rdquo;, and listen to almost only jazz albums. At the very least, I will have a &ldquo;Jazz Week&rdquo;, and perhaps a &ldquo;Jazz Two Weeks&rdquo;. Thing is, I could spend days just on the Miles Davis <em>Complete Bitches Brew Sessions</em> and the John Coltrane <em>Complete Village Vanguard Recordings</em> boxes themselves.</p>

<p>I was at Borders a couple of days ago, and listened to a performance of Rimsky-Korsakov&rsquo;s <em>Scheherazade</em> on one of the listening stations. In particular, the second movement (I forget the name) was great. I will be getting a CD of that piece from BMG (I&rsquo;ve been cross-referencing the performances on the BMG CDs with comments at rec.music.classical.recordings, in order to separate the gems from the crappy ones&hellip; up until now, I&rsquo;ve tried to get into classical by buying the cheapy CDs, but have failed to enjoy them &ndash; they tend to sound like they were recorded in broom closets). Especially when it comes to classical music, quality matters.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s been about half a month since I last wrote something here. Hmmph.</p></blockquote>

<p>What&rsquo;s happened in the meantime? Well, I am diving head-first into the realm of electronic music. I picked up what is apparently an &ldquo;ambient house&rdquo; classic, Global Communication&rsquo;s <em>76:14</em>. This sucker&rsquo;s great. It finds a middle ground between Steve Roach-style ambience and modern electronica (not unlike the middle ground post-rock (at least the &ldquo;drone-rock&rdquo; contingent) often establishes between ambient and rock). I do enjoy Steve Roach, but ambient with a stronger rhythmic presence tends to have a stronger effect on me.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s starting to seem that space/ambient music has the potential to be even more near and dear to me than more &ldquo;busy&rdquo; styles of music like jazz or prog-rock. I guess it shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising, given that the space rock bits in Pink Floyd are my favorite moments from that band&rsquo;s canon of music.</p>

<p>This new direction will eventually push me to the borders of both techno and New Age. At some point, I expect to eventually encounter stuff in those realms that repulses me &ndash; thus establishing the borders of where my tastes in this field run. What remains to be seen is whether these borders exist on the outskirts of these genres, or whether they&rsquo;re well into the heart of the genres (or perhaps the borders don&rsquo;t exist at all &ndash; in which case, Present and YETI can expect to be joined by Prodigy and Yanni in my CD case soon).</p>

<p>Oh, and the new Mogwai EP is good. Not quite <em>Rock Action</em> good or <em>EP+2</em> good, but it&rsquo;s <em>Young Team</em> good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Last night, I went on a quest: find a used copy of a Loreena McKennitt album (preferably <em>The Mask and Mirror</em>, but any of her three final full-length releases would have been acceptable). Three record stores later, I came home with no McKennitt in hand. I did come close to buying the new Mogwai EP, but I wasn&rsquo;t ready to drop $8 on a 20 minute EP without hearing it &ndash; even though the band&rsquo;s most recent album, <em>Rock Action</em>, has recently become my favorite release of theirs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon arriving at home, I ended up firing up <a href="http://www.bearshare.com/">BearShare</a> (which has replaced Morpheus as the first music client I go to for fairly &ldquo;popular&rdquo; music, and is second only to AudioGalaxy for overall use) and downloaded the various individual tracks that comprise <em>The Mask and Mirror</em>. Listening to it right now&hellip; while I find myself wishing for a warmer, less &ldquo;overt&rdquo; mix (i.e. not having vocals or the main instrumental melody slap you in the face and overpower the rest of the music), I do like what I hear, and will continue trying to find any of her last three albums in the used bins (I sure found a lot of Brian McKnight when I was looking&hellip; sheesh).</p>

<p>Music moment for the day: Sitting in a chair at the Health Center at the university, Discman headphones on, waiting for the results of some blood work from the lab, listening to Tarentel&rsquo;s <em>The Order of Things</em> (specifically, &ldquo;Ghosty Head&rdquo;, a Rickie Lee James cover) while reading the college newspaper&rsquo;s story about the rape awareness rally a couple of nights ago, and some of the stories retold there. The song in question is a quiet, piano and (very soft) female vocals piece. When listening to the song last night while driving, it seemed beautiful. When listening in the doctor&rsquo;s office while reading that newspaper story, it seemed chilling, frightening. The vocals, which had seemed so pretty before, seemed woundedly brooding this time. While it may not be Tori Amos&#8217; &ldquo;Me and a Gun&rdquo;, it sure was close. It invoked the same mood and feeling, at least at that moment in time. What remains to be seen is if the song will go back to sounding &ldquo;pretty&rdquo;, or if it will remain locked in the context of today&rsquo;s listen.</p>

<p>On a more upbeat note, I have continued my exercise routine to the letter. Not a single day&rsquo;s ride has been missed. As a result, I have lost 15 pounds since starting the exercise routine (which, when added to the 10 that I lost before starting, brings me to a total of 25 pounds lost since moving away from my hometown). I took an old bathroom scale from my parents&#8217; house, and have been tracking my weight daily. It sure is encouraging to see the number go down every few days.</p>

<p>Currently downloading the new Mogwai EP. Will give it a chance to earn an $8 purchase. If it can manage to be as good as <em>EP+2</em> or the most recent full-length album <em>Rock Action</em>, then I will not hesitate to grab it.</p>

<p>Also discovered a new band from AudioGalaxy downloads, Halifax Pier. Yet another band on the Temporary Residence label. I&rsquo;m going to have to start checking out artists specifically because they&rsquo;re on that label, because I keep finding cool new &ldquo;post-rock&rdquo; and other bands that are on TR.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>_Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn?</p></blockquote>

<p>Remember how she said that we would meet again&hellip;._</p>

<p>Why the Pink Floyd reference? Err, I dunno. The only Floyd albums I&rsquo;ve listened to in the last few months have been <em>Atom Heart Mother</em> and <em>Obscured By Clouds</em>, neither of which contain the song that the above is taken from (that&rsquo;s from <em>The Wall</em>). This is just a random lyric that appeared in my head.</p>

<p>Listened to Tortoise&rsquo;s <em>Standards</em>, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso&rsquo;s <em>Io Sono Nato Libero</em>, Sigur R√≥s&rsquo;s <em>√Åg√¶tis Byrjun</em>, and Cul de Sac&rsquo;s <em>Ecim</em>. The Tortoise, Banco, and Sigur R√≥s are all known quantities to me. The Cul de Sac was a bit new. It&rsquo;s a CD I&rsquo;ve had for a while, but have only listened to once. Second impressions? Good but very uneven. There are great moments of Krautrock-influenced stuff, but other parts are lame or annoying (couple songs with painful vocals). Their most recent album, <em>Crashes to Light, Minutes to Its Fall</em> is much better &ndash; at least, that&rsquo;s my opinion, based on my one listen to it and my two listens to <em>Ecim</em>. Cul de Sac certainly deserves some more listens, that&rsquo;s for sure&hellip;</p>
