  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Been a while since I posted (don&rsquo;t most of my posts start with that line?).  So what&rsquo;s happened musically as of late?</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>Linkin Park &ndash; In addition to &ldquo;In the End&rdquo;, I also like &ldquo;Crawling&rdquo;.  I have received much ridicule from the music snob circles. :)</p></li>
<li><p>Kylie Minogue &ndash; Damn you, Kelly. Damn you for making me download &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Get You Out of My Head&rdquo;. Now I&rsquo;ve seen the music video too. It&rsquo;s more than I dare to think about.</p></li>
<li><p>METAL &ndash; Metal, metal, metal, MEEETALLL. Fates Warning, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Queensrÿche, TOOL, Spiral Architect, Dream Theater, Neurosis, Therion, Black Sabbath, and I need more. I&rsquo;ve had to use some hard-rock (even The Who) for more fix. I&rsquo;ve been in a major metal mood. I think some later Iron Maiden would be cool. This one (<em>The Number of the Beast</em>) is a bit silly at times. The style is great but maybe some of the cheesiness is left off on later albums. <em>Powerslave</em> is next on my Maiden to-get list.</p></li>
<li><p>Krautrock &ndash; My Faust box set is always nearby. I recently got Can&rsquo;s <em>Ege Bamyasi</em>, downloaded some Electric Mud and Amon Düül II.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>It seems one of my friends and one of my online music buds are conspiring against me. And my friend&rsquo;s trying to drag my girl into it too. Like I told her (the friend), with friends like these, who needs enemies? I gotta admit, though, it&rsquo;s WAY more fun than last semester when I didn&rsquo;t really know anyone around here.</p>

<p>Ooh, and my best friend is coming to Fresno next semester after spending this semester in Monterey. Now maybe I&rsquo;ll finally be able to teach him an instrument.  Hmm, I&rsquo;m getting a bigger apartment now too&hellip; I should take my brother&rsquo;s drum kit (The World&rsquo;s Least Used Drum Set).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also playing my guitars far more than before, even writing some music. Usually when I&rsquo;m supposed to be doing homework. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>So, what&rsquo;s happened between my last post and now? Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you&hellip; CLASSES started. WORK started. Bluh&#8217;y hell. Let&rsquo;s review Hell, CSU Fresno style:</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>First level of Hell:</strong> Work.  Work requires me being up at 6:00am every morning (yes, it takes me that long to get to an 8:00 job, and yes, it&rsquo;s still a struggle to be on time). Work isn&rsquo;t as bad as it was last semester, as I&rsquo;m alone in the office now and I&rsquo;ll have my own Ethernet connection, and can play my own music (albeit at low volume levels)&hellip;. but I&rsquo;m still being given the same pointless crap to do.  If my job only revolved around PRODUCTIVE work, I&rsquo;d have two free hours a day. :)</p>

<p><strong>Second level of Hell:</strong> Women&rsquo;s Studies 110.  Representations of Women.  Male Bashing 101.  Let&rsquo;s put it this way&hellip; I would wipe my arse with this week&rsquo;s readings, but I fear for rectal infection. Making matters worse is an instructor that lacks organization.</p>

<p><strong>Third level of Hell:</strong> Computer Science 41.  Introduction to Data Structures.  Now, CompSci is fun. Programming is fun.  But this class is the class that weeds people out of the CompSci major. The highest dropout rate of any lower-division class in the university.  In the entire university.  Over 70% dropout rate. Some people take the class with a clean schedule &ndash; no other classes.  Well, I need to pass it this semester. Need only pass.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth level of Hell:</strong> Math 76.  Calculus. A repeat. It was crappy before. It promises to live up to last semester&rsquo;s crappiness.</p>

<p><strong>Fifth level of Hell:</strong> Economics in Film.  Looks to actually be a decent class. Only bad things: it&rsquo;s from 6-9pm, and it&rsquo;ll run late some nights&hellip; that&rsquo;s LONG. Plus, the room we&rsquo;re going to watch the movies in don&rsquo;t allow food, so no munchies during the films. Like, what&rsquo;s up with that?</p>

<p><strong>Sixth level of Hell:</strong> History of Rock and Jazz.  Only thing about this class is that I need to officially get into it (gotta show up tonight &ndash; the first class session). Another 6-9pm night class, but this one shouldn&rsquo;t run late like the film class will. The hard part about night classes is taking them seriously &ndash; it&rsquo;s not easy to pay attention to academics at that hour.</p>

<p>So basically, things at the University suck. As they do at most academic institutions, I would imagine. Keeping nice company after work/school hours makes it much more tolerable, though.</p>

<p>My next post will include some actual music content.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Interestingly, I&rsquo;ve been in more of a music buying mode than a music listening mode over the last couple of weeks. Last night, however, something &ldquo;clicked&rdquo; back into place, and I was enjoying my hobby much more than I have recently. I attribute this to a few things:</p></blockquote>

<p>(1) Bought a new pair of headphones. They&rsquo;re Koss TD-61&rsquo;s. Not audiophile by any stretch, but they are light, yet still the padded ear-encapsulating style. I have a pair of Sony&rsquo;s that sound great but are uncomfortable as hell. These Koss &lsquo;phones are about as good as you can ask a $20 pair of headphones to sound (and more so, if you ask me).</p>

<p>(2) Slowing down on the music acquiring and revisiting some old albums. My escapades into electronica, jazz, and so forth have been exciting and intriguing, but taking a break to take in some more good ol&#8217; post-rock, while also checking out a little bit of newer post-rock, has done me good.</p>

<p>(3) Jim Mora.  Just by being alive and on TV, Jim Mora makes me feel better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>My CD collection has grown quite a bit. Between Christmas, some vacation pillaging, and just some purchases on my own, I have lots of new music to listen to.</p></blockquote>

<p>Christmas gifts:</p>

<p>Beatles &ndash; <em>Revolver</em>: Pretty darn good. A few duff tracks (&ldquo;Yellow Submarine&rdquo; is blah, and &ldquo;Good Day Sunshine&rdquo; can go as well), but some great stuff as well.</p>

<p>Stravinsky &ndash; <em>&ldquo;Stravinsky&rdquo; (3CD set, SFSO w/Michael Tilson Thomas conducting)</em>: Haven&rsquo;t yet listened to this, but it was at the top of my Christmas CDs list. Spposedly a breathtaking recording of some great performances of three Stravinsky pieces. Grammy-award winning recording, and I&rsquo;ve heard that it was actually deserving of awards (you never know with the Grammy&rsquo;s these days, but the non-commercial awards appear less tainted than the headlining ones).</p>

<p>Radiohead &ndash; <em>Amnesiac</em>: Have had a CD-R made from MP3s up to this point. Asked for a real copy to replace it with. Got one.</p>

<p>McCoy Tyner &ndash; <em>The Real McCoy</em>: A jazz album that I wanted that BMG doesn&rsquo;t have.</p>

<hr />

<p>Stuff I bought on vacation (all used CDs):</p>

<p>Yes &ndash; <em>Magnification</em>: Wasn&rsquo;t looking to buy this, but when I saw a copy in the used bin, I couldn&rsquo;t resist.</p>

<p>Mr. Bungle &ndash; <em>California</em>: I haven&rsquo;t even listened to <em>Disco Volanté</em> enough, but I have heard that this album is great, so I went ahead and got it.</p>

<p>Hawkwind &ndash; <em>This Is Hawkwind Do Not Panic</em>: My favorite album title of all time. Don&rsquo;t know how much I like Hawkwind yet, but it was cheap.</p>

<p>King Crimson &ndash; <em>Thrak</em>: A decent album that I&rsquo;ve had as MP3s up until now, decided a real copy was worth having.</p>

<hr />

<p>10 cent CDs (yes, the record store I was at had a bin of used CDs that each cost 10 cents):</p>

<p>Stone Temple Pilots &ndash; <em>Purple</em>: I was glad to see this in the 10 cent bin. I had a copy a long time ago, but gave it to a friend. Glad to have one back, for so cheap. The hit songs are definitely the best material on here.</p>

<p>Econoline Crush &ndash; <em>The Devil You Know</em>: The music computer at the store listed them as &ldquo;industrial pop&rdquo; or &ldquo;industrial metal&rdquo;. Any time I see &ldquo;industrial&rdquo;, I am intrigued. For 10 cents, it seemed like something to grab.</p>

<p>Jewel &ndash; <em>Spirit</em>: Because, well, you never know when I&rsquo;ll have a girl over at my apartment that likes Jewel. Though I&rsquo;m bummed there wasn&rsquo;t any Lisa Loeb there instead&hellip;.</p>

<p>Second Coming &ndash; <em>Second Coming</em>: Well, the cover looked kinda cool. Listened to one song while on vacation, and was instantly reminded of Alice in Chains. Come home, look at AllMusic, and wouldn&rsquo;t ya know, the name &ldquo;Alice in Chains&rdquo; is mentioned everywhere in the band&rsquo;s info. :)  Hey, an AiC ripoff isn&rsquo;t the worst thing in the world. Worth 10 cents.</p>

<p>Juliana Hatfield &ndash; <em>Juliana&rsquo;s Pony: Total System Failure</em>: Not sure why I grabbed this one. Seen her name tossed around here and there.</p>

<p>Jesus Lizard &ndash; <em>Blue</em>: Who can resist noise-rock? Not me! Unfortunately, this isn&rsquo;t one of JL&rsquo;s &ldquo;classic&rdquo; albums, but is still supposed to be good.</p>

<p>Tal Bachman &ndash; <em>Tal Bachman</em>: Yes, of Bachman Turner Overdrive fame! Well, actually, the son of Randy Bachman. This is basically a &lsquo;70s-style pop album with Hammond B3 and Moog on it. For 10 cents, I&rsquo;ll take anything with a Hammond, even if it&rsquo;s just to hear how bad it is (this is supposed to be OK though). I&rsquo;m not expecting greatness, so I won&rsquo;t be disappointed. :)</p>

<hr />

<hr />

<p>Post-Christmas gift certificate purchases:</p>

<p>Autechre &ndash; <em>Tri Repetae++</em>: I&rsquo;m getting into interesting electronic artists.</p>

<p>Future Sound of London &ndash; <em>ISDN</em>: See above. This one actually features a little Robert Fripp too! :)</p>

<p>Robert Rich &ndash; <em>Trances/Drones</em>: One of the pioneering ambient artists, and this is his classic two complementary albums (now sold together as a single 2CD set).</p>

<p>Penderecki &ndash; <em>Orchestral Works</em>: A good recording of some of the best work of this 20th century composer.</p>

<p>Post-Christmas money purchases:</p>

<p>Tool &ndash; <em>Ænima</em>: I needed a CD copy of this!</p>

<p>Queensrÿche &ndash; <em>Operation: Mindcrime</em>: I was planning on getting this as a BMG selection, but when I saw it for $9.99 at Best Buy, I decided to just buy it and use the BMG selection on something that I can&rsquo;t get so cheaply.</p>

<p>mu-Ziq &ndash; <em>Royal Astronomy</em>: See Autechre &amp; FSOL above.</p>

<p>I still have over $80 left of Borders credit, so there will be more to come. Trying to decide if I should have them order some stuff for me (I want Orbital&rsquo;s <em>In Sides</em>! And maybe some Acid Mothers Temple).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Stuff I&rsquo;ve been listening to lately:</p></blockquote>

<p>Dream Theater &ndash; <em>Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence</em>: DT&rsquo;s new album isn&rsquo;t officially out yet, but has been leaked to various newsgroups and places like AudioGalaxy. I&rsquo;ve downloaded a copy and have listened to it a few times. A few songs, like &ldquo;Misunderstood&rdquo;, have made an impact, but for the most part, it&rsquo;s been pretty yawn-inducing. It&rsquo;s a two-disc album, and the entire second disc is one 40 minute title track suite. So far, it&rsquo;s pretty boring. :(</p>

<p>Yes &ndash; <em>Magnification</em>: Here&rsquo;s another boring album. I don&rsquo;t much want to talk about it (let&rsquo;s put it this way &ndash; I&rsquo;ve only made it to the end of the album once so far). I will say, though, that anyone that wants to hear what strings and horns in a prog-rock band can sound like when done WELL needs to hear Townscream&rsquo;s <em>Nagyvárosi Ikonok</em>.</p>

<p>Fates Warning &ndash; <em>Disconnected</em>: Surprisingly good. I liked <em>A Pleasant Shade of Gray</em>, of course. This one&rsquo;s different &ndash; a bit faster and louder. But it&rsquo;s still outstanding. Descriptions like &ldquo;a less-dark Tool&rdquo; would not be too far off the mark.</p>

<p>Dream Theater &ndash; <em>When Dream and Day Unite</em>: A naive, charming album. I actually like Charlie Dominici&rsquo;s &ldquo;mini-Geddy&rdquo; vocals. And while the whole band look like dorks in their pictures on the back of the CD, there&rsquo;s some cool tunes here. &ldquo;Ytse Jam&rdquo; is nice, of course, but &ldquo;Status Seeker&rdquo; kicks as well. Not a great album, but a decent one, and it&rsquo;s fun to listen to sometimes.</p>

<p>Halifax Pier &ndash; <em>The Halifax Pier</em>: Oy. I&rsquo;ve been saying that Global Communication&rsquo;s <em>76:14</em> is the best CD I&rsquo;ve bought this year, but maybe this one is. Violin, cello, and dual guitars create sweet, depressing soundscapes. Me likey.</p>
