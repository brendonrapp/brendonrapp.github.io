  <div class="entry-content"><p>My brother was struggling with a poor wifi connection from his upstairs room to the Airport router downstairs at his house. Given that it is a house he shares with roommates, I figured instead of trying to solve the problem of making wifi reach all ends of the house (especially since the house is in Los Angeles and I am not), I thought a better plan would be to make him a setup that will allow him to pick up wifi signals better, as well as repeat them in his local area.</p>

<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/UgsQMrfGyTGlfToDjgJXAQ?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_qL0aKA9MDVY/SeelU6rtzsI/AAAAAAAAAMk/84HCNXQyB2E/s400/118.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>So, inspired by <a href="http://www.i-hacked.com/content/view/261/42/">an article I read a few months back</a>, I cobbled together a little something to do the job. Not quite as elegant a form factor as the article&rsquo;s tripod-mounted beauty, but a little more sensible for setting up on top of a bookshelf, or carrying around in a duffel bag.</p>

<p>The key components here are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Linksys WRT54GL wifi router</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://shop3.frys.com/%7BlD6LaOuhZ7YvRiH4cTF8hA**.node2%7D/product/5286717">Super Cantenna</a> off-the-shelf &ldquo;cantenna&rdquo;-style 2.4 GHz antenna</p></li>
<li><p>DD-WRT firmware <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=185052">build with AutoAP included</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>The WRT54GL is the go-to router for anyone that wants to run open source firmware (and even if you&rsquo;re just a regular wifi user, you want this). Here, we use a build of the DD-WRT firmware with AutoAP built in, provided by the AutoAP Sourceforge project.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Autoap">AutoAP</a> is a brilliant little script that scans for open wifi connections, finds the strongest one that provides you a &ldquo;live&rdquo; connection to the Internet, and connects the router to this access point and repeats the signal. It also allows you to set a list of &ldquo;preferred&rdquo; networks for AutoAP to prioritize above random points. The easiest way to get AutoAP is to install a firmware image that comes with it. I used the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=185052">AutoAP NG v24 Micro</a> build offered up on AutoAP&rsquo;s Sourceforge downloads page.</p>

<p>Installation involves simply logging into the router&rsquo;s default firmware, and using the built-in firmware update function to &ldquo;update&rdquo; to the open-source firmware. (The Linksys firmware seems to like IE best &ndash; stupid Linksys &ndash; so for safety, I flash the firmware through IE. Though I have done it in other browsers before, I have also had the admin panel get pissy on non-IE browsers).</p>

<p>Once the DD-WRT firmware with AutoAP is installed, the router needs to be set up as a repeater. All the instructions you need on this part are here. The idea is to make the router set up to connect to remote access points as a client and repeat their signal, while also offering up its own SSIDÂ  that you connect to. The router&rsquo;s &ldquo;physical interface&rdquo; represents the router&rsquo;s connection to the remote access point, while the &ldquo;virtual interface&rdquo; is your private repeated version of that network, complete with the SSID and encryption of your choosing. This makes things easy, as while the router jumps to different access points, your client machines connect only to your private SSID.</p>

<p>When the router is properly set up to work as a repeater, then AutoAP can be used. AutoAP functionality can be accessed from a web browser at <a href="http://routerIP/user/cgi-bin/autoap.cgi.">http://routerIP/user/cgi-bin/autoap.cgi.</a> (Bookmark this, as it&rsquo;s not available through the regular DD-WRT panel). It&rsquo;s pretty self-explanatory as to how to turn &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;off&rdquo;. When turned on, it will connect to and begin repeating whatever open network it can find with the strongest signal. AutoAP will automatically &ldquo;fill in&rdquo; the SSID information of the newly-repeated network in DD-WRT&rsquo;s Basic Wireless settings tab (what you yourself would fill in if repeating a signal manually &ndash; and which you can still do when you switch AutoAP off. This is necessary when you want to repeat a WPA/WPA2 encrypted signal, as AutoAP can only deal with open or WEP-encrypted access pointsÂ  &ndash; and only the latter when keys are known).</p>

<p>A repeater works best with a nice high-gain antenna to work with. The <a href="http://shop3.frys.com/%7BlD6LaOuhZ7YvRiH4cTF8hA**.node2%7D/product/5286717">Super Cantenna</a> is a convenient off-the-shelf solution. Unlike the nearest Pringles can, it has a handy tripod that allows you to control tilt and even horizontal-axis rotation (&ldquo;rolling&rdquo; the cantenna away from it&rsquo;s &ldquo;upright&rdquo; position can lead to a better signal in some cases). Moreover, it&rsquo;s got an RP-SMA connector and an RP-TNC adapter. The WRT54GL&rsquo;s removable antenna connections are RP-TNC connectors, so the included adapter takes care of compatibility. Unscrew the existing antennas (at least one of them &ndash; you can leave one on if you want, which you may consider if you find you need an omnidirectional antenna to help extend the reach of your repeated signal), and using the Super Cantenna&rsquo;s RP-TNC adapter, screw the Cantenna in. Done!</p>

<p>You may want to play around with the &ldquo;Xmit Power&rdquo; option in DD-WRT&rsquo;s Wireless &ndash;> Advanced Settings area. Higher can mean better range, but too high can mean excess noise and degraded signal quality. It&rsquo;s something one has to play around with to find the optimal setting for their environment.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. Perfect for hopping onto the open wifi of the hotel next door, when your hotel proves to be too cheap to provide it themselves. Or, if you&rsquo;re in a living situation where you don&rsquo;t necessarily control all the wires, it lets you establish your personal repeated wifi haven.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In honor of <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/writers/peter_king/archive/">Peter King</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;5 Things I Think I Think&rdquo; musing on the NFL, I present my own &ldquo;five things&rdquo; on games I have recently played.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s kick things off with 5 Things I Think I Think about&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/EVGA/GeForce_8800_GS/images/farcry.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>1. I think I&rsquo;m in love with the &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; approach to shooter battles.</strong> The game Far Cry was when I was funneled through hallways and tunnels is probably a game I would have played and enjoyed, even if at a C+, B- level or so. The game Far Cry was when I was allowed to sneak through brush, survey hostiles in the distance, plan a course of action, and execute it, is a game I <em>loved</em>.</p>

<p>For a game that wasn&rsquo;t strictly a stealth action title, I was surprised at how reasonable and &ldquo;fair&rdquo; the enemy&rsquo;s ability to detect the player was. There were very, very few instances of &ldquo;how the heck did he &lsquo;see&rsquo; me?&rdquo;. I always felt comfortable that, if there was enough brush in front of me to block them from my view, I would in turn be blocked from their view.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the freedom of being able to approach situations from many different angles. I often eschewed taking vehicles and running through what was clearly a planned &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; sequence, opting instead to creep through the vegetation. It was extremely satisfying to be able to exercise a little <em>creativity</em> in playing the game. So many games really force you to flip the &ldquo;off&rdquo; switch in your brain and just follow in-game cues. How many times have you been playing a game and asked yourself, &ldquo;what am I <em>supposed</em> to do?&rdquo;, instead of, &ldquo;how <em>can</em> I approach this?&rdquo;. As gamers, we&rsquo;ve become conditioned to try and seek the designed course of action. Years and years of &ldquo;locked&rdquo; doors and invisible walls have taught us to turn off the brain and follow the cues.</p>

<p>Given this newfound love for &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; FPS battles, it seems like kismet that the FPS games at the top of my &ldquo;to-play&rdquo; list are the following: Crysis, Crysis: Warhead, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky, and Far Cry 2.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/trigen.jpg" alt="trigen" /></p>

<p><strong>2. I think the mutant menace was extremely overstated.</strong> I didn&rsquo;t play Far Cry back in 2004-05 (save for the demo), but like any forum-dwelling gamer, I&rsquo;m well aware of its reputation: &ldquo;a great game, until those damn <em>mutants</em> showed up&rdquo;. So when the mutants &ndash; Trigens &ndash; showed up in level 5 (of 20), I thought the jig might be up. I&rsquo;ve been disciplining myself to pull the plug on games before they outlive their ability to entertain me, as it&rsquo;s my nature to simply want to <em>finish</em> them anyway. So, from mission 5 onward, we were on orange alert. And a few early encounters almost led to premature deletion, as getting pounced by one of those bastards was essentially insta-death.</p>

<p>But just before it all fell apart, the tides turned. I got a semiautomatic combat shotgun, giving me a capable counter to the pouncing mutants in close encounters. Then the &ldquo;CryVision&rdquo; night vision/thermal goggles were acquired, allowing me to hunt <em>them</em> in the outdoor areas. The mutants didn&rsquo;t dominate the rest of the game, as new enemies are often so prone to do &ndash; just when a mutant-heavy sequence would become tiresome, the game would swing back to encounters against theÂ  reasonably clever human AI enemies. And most important, the tunneled indoor areas always gave way to more expansive outdoor segments, returning the game to its bread and butter.</p>

<p>I would have preferred the game sans-mutants, which makes Far Cry 2 appealing, even if it&rsquo;s quite a different game. But the mutants failed to live up to their game-destroying reputation.</p>

<p><strong>3. I think I like ridiculous, juvenile &ldquo;sexual content&rdquo; a little too much.</strong> Please don&rsquo;t misunderstand me. I know a pathetic appeal to teenage nerd sexual fantasy when I see it. Like the obnoxious fawning from the demon girl in Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. But here&rsquo;s the thing&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/farcryval01.jpg" alt="farcryval01" /></p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/farcryval02.jpg" alt="farcryval02" /></p>

<p>&hellip; I just don&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p>I love it. Exaggerated virtual girls with over-the-top, oversexed attitudes and bodies to match&hellip; I love it all. No matter how fake, or how transparent the manipulation, I&rsquo;ll happily wallow in a sea of horny video game girls.</p>

<p><strong>4. I think waiting a few years to play the game was a good idea (also: Steam sales are the best).</strong> When the game was new, playing Far Cry at 1680x1050 with everything cranked to Very High would&rsquo;ve been a pipe dream. But with a nice midrange 8800 GT, that&rsquo;s exactly how I played the game, with a framerate that was permanently well above 60 fps. So, so butter smooth. I&rsquo;m a stickler for framerate. Nothing looks better than a game that runs silky smooth. I have Far Cry 2, and I can get good framerates with decent detail settings right now, but I&rsquo;m not firing up the game again until I get my new video card.</p>

<p>I bought Far Cry a couple of weekends ago, during Ubisoft&rsquo;s week of Steam sales. The weekend sale was a 4-pack: Beyond Good and Evil, Far Cry, IL-2 Sturmovik, and Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, all for $9.99. I already owned BG&amp;E and IL-2, but I figured that would just make Far Cry and Dark Messiah $5 each. I definitely got my $5 out of Far Cry.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never regretted a Steam sale purchase, but I continue to regret purchases I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> make (WHY did I not buy Vampire: Bloodlines for $10 back in October??)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/farcry01.jpg" alt="farcry01" /></p>

<p><strong>5. I think I&rsquo;m glad I played the game on Medium difficulty.</strong> Far Cry was not a forgiving game. I think one of the reasons I was able to live with the mutant presence was because I wasn&rsquo;t playing on one of the advanced difficulty levels. Playing on harder difficulty levels is something that I&rsquo;m trying to discipline myself into doing. Too often, I cheat myself out of a rewarding challenge by just going with the default difficulty setting. Although it is fun to just blast through a game with no frustration, I have found that, like a badly coached sports team, I &ldquo;play down&rdquo; to the competition. I just cruise through on autopilot, and eventually find certain parts hard because I&rsquo;m not <em>really</em> trying.</p>

<p>Far Cry was not one of those games. I have no doubt that I could have prevailed on higher difficulty settings, but with a lot more frustration. Certain scenes clearly exist to beat the player senseless and force him/her to re-play the section many times in order to &ldquo;get it right&rdquo;. I was certainly annoyed by a couple of them, and I have no doubt that dealing with them on a hard difficulty would&rsquo;ve put a real dent in my enjoyment of the game. For this title at least, chickening out was the right way to go.</p>
