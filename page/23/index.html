<p>Planned features for MonkeyPox:</p>

<ol>
<li>It will be written in C++, fully object-oriented.</li>
<li>It will be written using the OpenGL and SDL APIs.</li>
<li>It will be cross-platform. Development will be done on Linux and Mac OS  X. Milestone builds will be built and tested on Windows.</li>
<li>It will  load models and levels of currently-undecided formats (possibilities:  Quake 2/3 BSP and MD2/MD3, 3D Studio Max .3ds, and others).</li>
<li>It  will not inspire fear in John Carmack. :)  But it will make for a great  class project, and tech demo come time for employment.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since my graphics project for next semester&rsquo;s graphics class will be a  3D game, I am currently working on writing a 3D game engine using OpenGL  and SDL.</p>

<p>It would be awful nice to have the framework for an engine written and ready before the class even starts.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m  kind of excited about it, as it would be the first project of mine  really worthy of note. The OpenGL paint program was a nice learning  experience, but it was nothing special (hence the window title: &ldquo;OpenGL  Paint Program &ndash; Not Very Special&rdquo;).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am laptop-less.</p>

<p>My Thinkpad is now in the possession of my  parents, per an agreement. They told me that they wanted the laptop &ndash;  which I was planning on selling in order to help add to the Powerbook  fund. I told them if they wanted my laptop, they could have it &ndash; but  that they had to kick in enough money to guarantee that I get my  Powerbook &ndash; not just an iBook or something.</p>

<p>They agreed, and  since their desktop PC is currently out of commission and sitting right  here waiting for my attention, I gave them the laptop early. Of course,  this leaves me with no laptop at the moment. I&rsquo;ve taken for granted how  nice it was to sit in the living room with my laptop, even if it is an  older machine.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been told that we&rsquo;re ordering the Powerbook  in about 2 weeks. I&rsquo;m selling a bunch of stuff on eBay to come up with  some money for it in the meantime.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There will be no NFL2K4. At least, no game will release under that name.</p>

<p>Instead, the game that would&rsquo;ve been called NFL2K4 will be known as ESPN NFL Football.</p>

<p>The  funny thing is that I predicted this many months ago. Or at least  suggested it. The NFL2K name has no marketing power. The ESPN license  does. And since NFL2K3 was disappointing saleswise (not quality wise),  it&rsquo;s not surprising to see Sega capitalize on the ESPN license.</p>

<p>The  only danger is that someone (Acclaim?) released some horrible football  games years ago under the ESPN license. But I think the quality will  shine through.</p>

<p>It gets more interesting, though. ESPN NFL  Football will have a first-person (!!!) passing mode. I think this will  be very interesting, though it remains to be seen how it will work. I  have been dreaming of a game to try this, although I never had a good  image of how it would work well. It remains to be seen. Visual Concepts  has massive cojones to give this a shot &ndash; let&rsquo;s see if they pull it off.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thursday came, and I presented my project. Seemed to do well, and that brings my graphics class to an end.</p>

<p>In  the fall, I take the advanced computer graphics course. I&rsquo;m already  planning my project &ndash; a 3D game. Of what sort, I have not decided. I do  know, however, that the GLUT toolkit that I used for my paint program  won&rsquo;t cut it. So, I am going to use SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer), a  cross-platform multimedia library that has been used for porting  commercial-level games to Linux (like Civilization: Call to Power, and  America&rsquo;s Army). It should prove to be much more suitable than GLUT was.</p>

<p>So,  I went to Barnes &amp; Noble and bought the only SDL book that I&rsquo;m  really aware of: &ldquo;Focus on SDL&rdquo; in the Game Development Series of books  by Premier Press (I own another book in this series on game design). I  also bought a book I&rsquo;ve been wanting for a while: Herb Sutter&rsquo;s  &ldquo;Exceptional C++&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a book on solving production-level code problems  with C++. I want to step up my C++ coding, and these killer books in  the &ldquo;C++ In Depth&rdquo; series of Addison-Wesley publishing should help me do  that (&ldquo;Accelerated C++&rdquo; is still the best C++ intro text I&rsquo;ve yet seen,  and is still recommended by many pro programmers to newbies).</p>

<p>I  never stop working. :)  One quote from Game Developer Magazine still  sticks with me. Someone said something along the lines of, &ldquo;there are  virtually no great programmers in gaming, and even good ones are rare.&rdquo;  So I want to be at least a good programmer, though that won&rsquo;t be  achieved without some years in the industry. But every bit of work now  makes the learning curve that much shorter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, Derek and Logan came to crash at the apartment yesterday. We spent most of the day shopping and playing at the nickel arcade (which has added a number of games since the last time I went, and vastly improved the &ldquo;free play&rdquo; offerings). We spent $2 in there, and about $2 each on constant gameplay for the next 2 hours or so. Usually you go into an arcade and blow $5 in about 15 minutes. :) It&rsquo;s nice for those of us that can get a kick out of a mix of yesteryear&rsquo;s games and some classics (Super Off Road was awesome).</p>

<p>Anyway, at my request, Derek brought his Apple laptop (15&#8221; PowerBook G4). I played around with it, and got a little more familiar with OS X. I was happy when I got myself to a command line. :) Spending a little while on it helped fully &ldquo;sell&rdquo; me on the Apple.</p>

<p>Got very little done for my project Saturday and today. I&rsquo;m working on it now. I need to make it feature-complete pretty much by the end of tomorrow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>My PS2 game collection has increased by three (well, sorta).</p></blockquote>

<p>I went to Software Etc. and bought a used copy of ICO for $19.99. I also got a used PSX memory card.</p>

<p>Later, Derek and Shelby came over (for like 15 minutes &ndash; F1 racing was coming on, and they had to go watch) and Derek brought his copies of Metal Gear Solid 2 and Dark Cloud for me to borrow. Excellent.</p>

<p>Shelby asked &ldquo;which beanbag is it that Stacey says is hers and nobody else can sit in it?&rdquo;. I told her it was the gray one. She then grabbed that beanbag and sat down in it.</p>

<p>I also got my DirecTV equipment today. Satellite TV pending soon&hellip;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Jacksonville&rsquo;s defense was nowhere to be found today. That, paired with a head shot taken by Brunell, led to a Jaguars loss. :(</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Finished installing my wireless network yesterday. My wireless router is now handling all my routing duties, rather than my FreeBSD box. Is this because I thought the hardware router would be better? No, it&rsquo;s because I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to make the router act as only a wireless access point. I must say, it is easier to administrate the SMC Barricade than it is FreeBSD <em>ipnat</em> (though I got pretty handy at typing &ldquo;vi /etc/ipnat.rules&rdquo; and &ldquo;ipnat -CF -f /etc/ipnat.rules&rdquo;).</p></blockquote>

<p>So, anyway, Stacey and I went to the fair today. The food was good. Don&rsquo;t ask me how I managed to avoid eating the barbecue ribs, though. Just never had time to sit down and eat them. Pizza and nachos and snowcones are edible on the move. Anyway, the Michelle Branch concert was fun. Granted, pop music isn&rsquo;t my style, but I prefer Branch&rsquo;s style of music over the whiz-bang of so-called &ldquo;bubblegum pop&rdquo;. At least it&rsquo;s honest, and not manufactured. So I was able to enjoy myself. I&rsquo;m still far more looking forward to hearing TOOL play, naturally, but this was enjoyable. Stacey and I took some pictures &ndash; they&rsquo;ll be on each of our sites eventually.</p>

<p>Driving down to Porterville tomorrow to watch the football games tomorrow. A nice way to cap off a fun weekend. I needed a good weekend too, because the exam studying starts again on Monday (my C SCI 112 assembly language exam is on Friday, and it&rsquo;s going to be TOUGH. I have SO much studying to do for it).</p>
