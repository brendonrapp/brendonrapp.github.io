  <div class="entry-content"><p>The US Senate has <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/ap/o/51/05-10-2005/abdc0009968d5d93.html">voted in favor of the creation of a federal boxing commission</a>. As I understand it, this would essentially wipe out the influence of entities like the WBA, WBO, and all the rest of the boxing alphabet soup (which has given us nonsense like 3 different heavyweight &ldquo;champions&rdquo;). This understanding is advanced by <a href="http://www.ringtalk.com/news/view_article.asp?id=349&amp;cat=4" title="">a Ringtalk.com article</a> that states that the commission would be &ldquo;deathblow to sanctioning bodies like the WBC, IBF, WBA, WBO, etc&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The commission, to be called the USBC (United States Boxing Commission), would give us unified rules on fights and licensing of fighters, standards for judges and referees (something the sport badly needs), standards for standby medical help, and perhaps most important, a single, consistant ranking system of boxers. No more having 20 different rankings of fighters.</p>

<p>This bill, sponsored by Senator John McCain, is a direct attack at the corruption in the sport of boxing and the power structures that facilitate it. It would not only lead to a cleaner sport, but having a single set of actual rankings and titles will make the sport infinitely more fan friendly.</p>

<p>The Senate passed the bill with a voice vote, and now the bill needs to be approved by the House of Representatives. As a boxing fan, my fingers are crossed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The MTV show may have been worthless, but a number of Web sources have the real dirt on the Xbox 360.</p>

<p><a href="http://msxb.wmod.llnwd.net/a274/o2/ourcolony/TheColony_v1_750k.wmv">This video from the OurColony site</a> shows off the system a lot more than MTV did, and features a lot more insight.</p>

<p>Gamespot.com has the best source of info in a big article: <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/features/6124293/index.html?q=1&amp;tag=gs_x360_topslot_click">Xbox 360 Inside and Out</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://xbox.boomtown.net/en_uk/articles/art.view.php?id=8156">An interview with Robbie Bach</a> on Boomtown.net provides another perspective.</p>

<p>Some things of note:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wireless controllers, standard. The system has no wired controller ports. All wireless.</p></li>
<li><p>The system features a centralized menu system that can be accessed at any time by pressing the big center &ldquo;X&rdquo; button (even during a game). It looks like the Xbox Dashboard with ten times as much functionality.</p></li>
<li><p>The current design comes with a 20GB hard drive. The system can be used without a hard drive, so there may still be versions of the system sold without hard drives. 64MB memory cards can be used too. Of particular note, the hard drive is external and easily removeable.</p></li>
<li><p>Custom soundtracks in all games. But not only can you rip music to the hard drive, you can also plug in your portable MP3 player (including Apple&rsquo;s iPod, shockingly enough), and use playlists from there as your custom playlists in the game.</p></li>
<li><p>The DVD drive is to be able to read all forms of CD writeable and DVD writeable media, as well as CDs/DVDs that play MP3s and even photo CDs.</p></li>
<li><p>No announcement on backwards compatability &ndash; may be announced at E3. The quiet word seems to be that they have worked hard on having such a feature, but have not yet gotten it to the point where it is 99% functional. It needs to be almost perfect to actually include it as a feature in the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Xbox Live features a TON of new functionality, from more detailed stat/achievement tracking to more detailed friends/clan setups, as well as a much-needed &ldquo;Reputation&rdquo; system (to help you sort out the &ldquo;good&rdquo; players from the loser kiddies). The new thing is the idea of a &ldquo;GamerCard&rdquo;, which is a listing of your info and all of your online achievements</p></li>
<li><p>Xbox Live &ldquo;Marketplace&rdquo; for buying downloadable content, including microtransactions for new skins/decals/etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Movies and demos downloadable over Live</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Lots of features that have me excited. All of the Xbox Live stuff has me dying to get the new system.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow. That was terrible.</p>

<p>I thought unveiling the Xbox 360 on TV instead of at E3 was a nice idea, because most people don&rsquo;t get to attend E3.</p>

<p>But this wasn&rsquo;t a console unveiling. They didn&rsquo;t show much at all. Somehow they managed to produce 30 minutes of TV without actually <em>doing</em> anything.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I talked about podcasting (radio shows put online for automated downloading and listening on MP3 players anytime) a few weeks ago. Since then, podcasting has become even more popular, and the amount of content available has exploded. Sites like <a href="http://www.podcastalley.com">Podcast Alley</a> help sort things out, but there are some great shows that are rated lowly on Podcast Alley &ndash; everything&rsquo;s so new and still trying to find its audiences.</p>

<p>So I am expanding my podcast subscriptions to sample more programs in areas of interest to me, and then contracting by cutting out the stuff not worth my time, then expanding again for the next wave of new stuff. There&rsquo;s lots of room for better word-of-mouth advertising, so I&rsquo;m going to share my findings here. Hopefully it will help steer people to good podcasts (and away from crap).</p>

<p>One of the shows I&rsquo;ve begun listening to (but has been around for a while) is <a href="http://www.lugradio.org/">LugRadio</a>. LugRadio is a show about the Linux operating system and related software. The hosts are a quartet of crass Brits, who tend to start segments with good intentions before devolving into silly chaos. I&rsquo;d be tempted to call it Python-esque, though doing so would probably just reveal this American&rsquo;s ignorance in British humor on the whole. In any case, the humor seems sincere, rather than forced. Whether it&rsquo;s establishing &ldquo;pi&rdquo; as a legal score on a 5-point rating scale, or responding to someone&rsquo;s complaint about &ldquo;language&rdquo; (intending foul language) by speaking in &ldquo;f&mdash;king clicking noises&rdquo;, there&rsquo;s always some unabashed nonsense in the hour&rsquo;s time between start and finish.</p>

<p>It works, though, because there&rsquo;s content among the insanity. The last episode contained a great interview with the President/CEO of Linspire, and actually kinda sold me on their place in the Linux ecosystem. The show before that had an excellent interview with a usability guru from the GNOME project. Always something interesting to hear.</p>

<p>LugRadio is much more entertaining than more typical (read: stuffy) tech-oriented shows. Definitely not &ldquo;work safe&rdquo;, but with the help of some headphones, it helps pass an hour of my work week more quickly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two weeks left before finals, and counting. Much work to be done in the meantime.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve sacked my desktop computer, and am using my laptop computer plus my desktop LCD in a dual-screen setup. Very neat. Only catch so far is that ATI&rsquo;s video drivers for Linux, fglrx, don&rsquo;t support two displays using different resolutions in Dual Head mode. I get distorted video on the second screen. Yet, if I use Big Desktop mode, it works fine (but I don&rsquo;t want Big Desktop mode, because I want windows to maximize to only one screen).</p>

<p>I recently discovered Microsoft&rsquo;s OneNote software. It&rsquo;s the note-taking software I&rsquo;ve been looking for for years. So I&rsquo;ll be using Windows pretty frequently until I can get OneNote to run in Linux using WINE or Crossover Office or something (maybe I&rsquo;ll go so far as to set up a VMWare environment, though I&rsquo;d prefer something without so much overhead).</p>

<p>I have to say, Windows has managed to be very tolerable for me, thanks to some of the software I&rsquo;ve been using to keep it hassle free. I just wish I didn&rsquo;t need to always commit so much RAM to virus protection and spyware protection and so on.</p>

<p>Just installed Ubuntu back onto this machine. The &ldquo;kubuntu&rdquo; packages give me a KDE desktop in Ubuntu without so much hassle, though the packages still have a ways to go. Lots of improvements on the Ubuntu front &ndash; it could conceivably end up as my &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; distro.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve finished the single-player mode of Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. The series ranks among my very favorites, so as you can imagine, I had a good time with this game. A little bit of the &ldquo;wow&rdquo; factor has been lost along the way, given that this is the third game in the same console generation. It is, however, probably the most well-executed one. If there&rsquo;s disappointment, it would be merely that it does not blow the last offering, Pandora Tomorrow, out of the water. Given that Pandora Tomorrow was a superb game that was denied sufficient &ldquo;Game of the Year&rdquo; opportunities thanks to its early-year release (the game that impressed you 8 months ago doesn&rsquo;t quite maintain the same &ldquo;bang&rdquo; as the game that impressed you two weeks ago), one can&rsquo;t exactly take that as a very negative statement. Chaos Theory&rsquo;s missions were consistantly good, but perhaps not as inspired as the very best of Pandora Tomorrow&rsquo;s offerings (but probably more consistant across the board).</p>

<p>Another disappointment, though, would be the loss of Dennis Haysbert (from <em>24</em>, <em>Major League</em>, and the All-State commercials) as the voice of Irving Lambert. The actor that played the role in the original game returns. He&rsquo;s good, but nowhere near as powerful and commanding of a voice as Haysbert. Some of the other voice actors aren&rsquo;t so good, though. The core characters (all returning actors from previous versrions) are great, but a few of the characters you encounter in the field could be a lot better. I guess it&rsquo;s nice when you can be picky about the voices of small part characters &ndash; only because the major characters are so good.</p>

<p>The inclusion of an excellent co-op mode, as well as the return and improvement of the &ldquo;spies vs. mercenaries&rdquo; mode introduced in Pandora Tomorrow, really pushes Chaos Theory to the top.</p>

<p>Reportedly, the next Splinter Cell game will be on both the current AND the next-generation consoles. Splinter Cell represents some of the best of the current generation&rsquo;s technology, and is a prime choice to showcase the next gen&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m worried, though, that the next game won&rsquo;t take full advantage of the power of the next-gen consoles, if it also has to be ported to the current systems. Apparently the next game will be done by Ubisoft Shanghai, who did Pandora Tomorrow (Ubisoft Montreal did the original and Chaos Theory). The tag-team approach of having each developer do every other Splinter Cell game is unique, and so far, quite effective. It lets Ubi keep the Splinter Cell games coming, while giving them each enough development time to be A-level titles.</p>

<p>I plan to be playing this game on Xbox Live for some time to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post has nothing to do with girls, but I put it on that category just as an excuse to show the Rachael Leigh Cook icon for this category (if you&rsquo;re reading on LJ or Xanga, follow the link at the bottom of this post to my site)&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve finally started going back to work and class. My throat&rsquo;s still raw, but my energy&rsquo;s (mostly) back.</p>

<p>My birthday is Friday. I&rsquo;ve got a laptop coming. Waving bye-bye to my Powerbook won&rsquo;t be easy. Kids, unless you&rsquo;re playing a bunch of computer games (or learning to develop them), get yourself a nice Apple computer. There ain&rsquo;t no reason to be usin&#8217; no Windows systems if you&rsquo;re just web browsing and word processing.</p>

<p>Halo 2 is starting to get underneath my skin. It&rsquo;s so easy to just hop on and within a minute, be in an online game. My dad wants an Xbox and Halo 2. He&rsquo;s turning 51 in May and he&rsquo;s wanting an Xbox. That&rsquo;s my pops.</p>

<p>Now, to stare at my wonderful icon&hellip;..</p>
