<p>Fantastic, unusual, experimental release, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Amon+Tobin">Amon Tobin</a>&rsquo;s first true studio album in 5 years. This is very much a departure from his classic studio albums. More often, the album&rsquo;s tone is evocative of the Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory soundtrack, except without the restrictions that soundtrack pieces have to abide by. It&rsquo;s cut from a lot of field recordings and real instrumentation, including a track that incorporates the Kronos Quartet. It strays even further away from any dance roots present in previous Amon Tobin studio albums, and has received flak from fans of dance music for it. It&rsquo;s NOT just an exercise in sound manipulation, though, as Tobin does a great job of incorporating melody, sometimes with very subtle means. This strikes me as a transition record, not yet a final destination. I&rsquo;m not sure what kind of legs it will have, but so far I think it&rsquo;s pretty fantastic and I&rsquo;m glad to see Tobin pushing forward and not settling into familiar patterns.</p>

<p>From the sound of the detractors, you&rsquo;d think Explosions in the Sky is the new AC/DC, with a ton of same-sounding albums. This is, of course, only their 4th studio album (and you can pretty much forget the 1st one, a not-yet-ready-for-prime-time release that the band resisted reissuing until fan demand became too great to ignore). On the surface, this sounds very much like the past 3 albums, but to leave things at that is to make a very shallow comparison. The last album took away some of the edge from the band&rsquo;s 2nd album, while this album regains some of that edge in a more concise form. Instrumental buildups are more abbreviated here, and some piano-driven melodies add some extra color to the band&rsquo;s typical twangy guitar sound. This is an excellent album, I&rsquo;d probably rank it #2 behind 2001&rsquo;s &ldquo;Those Who Tell the Truth&hellip;.&rdquo;. It does seem to be a bit of a transitional album, and hopefully the band will continue to diversify around their great core sound.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Circle">Circle</a> (feat. Verde) &ndash; Tower: Circle sure releases a lot of albums. Counting Tyrant (released in 2006 in UK but 2007 in US), they&rsquo;re already up to 3 this year. Tower is very serene and laid back compared to the group&rsquo;s typical neo-Krautrock jams. This is very subdued and atmospheric, but with a steady yet soft fusion groove to keep things moving along. I saw it compared to early Weather Report and that&rsquo;s maybe not too far off the mark. Not a challenging listen but a nicely dreamlike one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve posted before about Stacey and games. Now that we&rsquo;re married, Stacey&rsquo;s gaming habit is being helped into high gear.</p>

<p>Stacey already loves playing puzzle games (Zuma!), and novel games like Guitar Hero or Katamari Damacy. However, she has long watched me play shooter games with my friends, and it&rsquo;s her turn to get in on that action.</p>

<p>So, the first thing she needs is to master the dual-thumbstick aiming of console shooters. Once you have that skill, you can jump from game to game (and with games like Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2 coming out, we will have games to jump to). Thus begins Stacey&rsquo;s Basic Weapons Training.</p>

<p>Her first game in this training is Halo 2, an easy choice because it has an &ldquo;Easy&rdquo; difficulty setting, so that she can learn without getting wasted instantly a la Rainbow Six. Improvement has been steady, and it won&rsquo;t be long before she finds a comfort zone. It won&rsquo;t be long before she&rsquo;s playing online.</p>

<time datetime="2007-02-17T13:12:44-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 17<span>th</span>, 2007</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been increasingly dissatisfied with Play Magazine in recent months. I grow tired of the constant over-coverage of any anime-licensed game, and the high scores for these often barely-functional pieces of junk.</p>

<p>The last straw, as one might put it, is Dave Halverson&rsquo;s review of Sonic the Hedgehog, another barely-functional game, this one for the Xbox 360.</p>

<p>Most media outlets gave the game a very low score, below a 5 out of 10. Halverson gave the game a 9.5. Now, bucking conventional opinion isn&rsquo;t a crime. However, this, like many other platformer games in the past, reeks of Halverson fanboyism. Halverson later fessed to the fact that his review copy had the same insane loading times that the final game did, yet because he was promised these would be fixed in the final game, he did not account for them in his review. Of course, optimization is among the final processes a piece of software goes through, and reviewing not-quite-complete game code requires taking this into account. Still, some degree of critical thinking is required, rather than taking the promise at face value. Halverson later updated his review, adjusting the score to a still quite laughable 8.5.</p>

<p>Even all of that isn&rsquo;t enough to make me stop reading. Sure, Halverson is entitled to his opinion, even if that opinion is so rose-colored as to be nearly useless to anyone not named Dave Halverson (which is a problem when it comes to reviews). Here is the real problem, in Halverson&rsquo;s updated review:</p>

<blockquote><p>Sonic isnâ€™t for everybodyâ€”itâ€™s for fans. Just as a game like SOCOM or Medal of Honor 10 is for fans. <strong>Iâ€™d give any military FPS a 3-5 tops for the sheer fact that theyâ€™re so very tired, not to mention packed with realistic killingâ€¦which is why I donâ€™t review military FPS titles</strong>. I donâ€™t like them but I respect the opinions of people that do enough not to insult them. <strong>Shame the door doesnâ€™t swing both ways.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>I had to basically pick my jaw up off the floor after reading that. Suddenly, everything makes sense. Although a truly &ldquo;objective&rdquo; review is impossible, as personal opinions and biases will always factor in, any reasonable reviewer (or even game fan) should be able to recognize intrinsic level of quality in a product that isn&rsquo;t necessarily one&rsquo;s favorite genre. A &ldquo;professional&rdquo; reviewer claiming that an entire genre would get no better than &ldquo;a 3-5 tops&rdquo;, and then trying to justify that mentality by saying &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t review them&rdquo; would be a joke if it weren&rsquo;t so unfunny. (I also love the claim that the genre is &ldquo;so very tired&rdquo;, as if 3D platformers like Sonic aren&rsquo;t every bit as &ldquo;tired&rdquo;). As someone who is very soured on Japanese console RPGs, I could not imagine claiming that I would never give such a game a high score just because I don&rsquo;t like the genre. It&rsquo;s not hard to recognize quality. A critic should recognize his own biases, but also recognize a good product even if it&rsquo;s not in line with those personal biases. That would be called &ldquo;being a professional&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s the kicker at the end. Halverson erects a nice straw man by confessing his own biases, and then obliterates it by implying that those who pan Sonic are just biased against it &ndash; but worse, they aren&rsquo;t confessing them and thus are intellectually dishonest.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s become crystal clear that Halverson has no concept of being a professional. Some accuse him of being a hype factory for his precious platformers, regardless of whatever the actual reality of those games may be. I don&rsquo;t know if Halverson deludes himself into buying into his own excitement for the game, or if he truly does like the games as much as he says he does. What is obvious, though, is that he lacks the clear, rational, even-handed critical thought to write reviews that are of use to anyone else. Because, as some forget, that is the point of printed reviews. That is why people spend $5 to buy the magazine &ndash; to get reviews that are useful to THEM, not to read a Dave Halverson love-letter in the guise of a review. A review needs to be informative to the reader. Failing to point out the myriad of flaws and even game-damaging bugs games like Sonic the Hedgehog have make Halverson&rsquo;s reviews a complete failure at what should be their intended purpose: informing potential customers. A game review written for any other purpose is not a review at all.</p>

<p>So, I am voting with my dollars. Once my Play subscription lapses (very soon), that will be the end of that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I performed a little test. I wanted to see how well a DVD upscaled to 1080i looked compared with a non-upscaled DVD, as well as compared with the same thing in true HD.</p>

<p>I took my Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers DVD, and loaded up The Two Towers in HD on demand through Comcast cable.</p>

<p>I played the movie on my Xbox 360 DVD player (480p), on my Philips upscaling DVD (480p upscaled to 1080i), and then the HD Comcast version (1080i).</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the HD version was the most detailed, and the non-upscaled DVD was the least sharp.</p>

<p>Where my interest lied is where the upscaled DVD fell on this spectrum. Happily, it was closer to the HD picture than the non-upscaled DVD picture.</p>

<p>CNet warned that upscaling &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t do miracles&rdquo;, but I was pleased with the marked improvement in sharpness in the upscaled DVD picture. This was especially evident in the menu screen before the movie loaded, where one could view black text on a white-ish background, and really compare the sharpness. The upscaled DVD was much sharper than the non-upscaled DVD, and rivaled the HD picture.</p>

<p>During actual scenes, subtle detail appeared in the HD picture that did not appear (or at least was not as pronounced) in even the upscaled DVD image.</p>

<p>Granted, this test was not perfect &ndash; only the upscaling DVD player was connected via HDMI, the other two devices were connected via component. But HDMI doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean a better picture, either.
It may not do &ldquo;miracles&rdquo;, but this little unscientific test made me glad that I got an upscaling DVD player. It&rsquo;s impressive, and makes me wonder how necessary HD-DVD and Blu-Ray really are (certainly an improvement, but not one that&rsquo;s going to have me replacing my old DVDs anytime soon &ndash; maybe NEXT format war)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Got an HDTV? Then you probably have (or need) some HDMI cables. HDMI cables are the preferred means of connecting video equipment to HD-enabled display devices. They&rsquo;re digital and offer the highest quality available.</p>

<p>Problem is, they&rsquo;re expensive. Unnecessarily expensive. At Best Buy, they start from about $60 and go up from there.</p>

<p>A website called monoPrice.com, however, sells 6&#8217; HDMI cables for about $5.</p>

<p>Five bucks? They have to be crap, right?</p>

<p>Nope. With digital signals, cable &ldquo;quality&rdquo; is less of an issue. But most importantly, there&rsquo;s no reason for HDMI cables to cost $60-100 anyway. High-end video people are used to spending big on cables (which, in the analog days, WAS necessary for top quality), and so cable manufacturers are all too willing to mark cables up high, even if they don&rsquo;t belong at that price.</p>

<p>The people at AVS Forums (a hardcore A/V crowd) love the monoPrice cables.</p>

<p>So, don&rsquo;t get fooled into paying sky-high prices for HDMI or DVI cables. The markups above $10 are just pure profit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Something new I have decided to do with this page is to post things I read online that I find to be insightful, or at least a concise bit of knowledge or opinion found in my travels through the internet ether. Some of them may be obvious to some people, but others may find something of interest in them.
This comes from Jun-Dai from the Criterion forums, on the topic of high-definition video disc (Blu-Ray, HD-DVD) adoption:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>I&rsquo;ll eat my hat if DVD isn&rsquo;t the highest quality home video format in the US with more than 10% adoption for the next five years at least. The format war isn&rsquo;t the biggest of the obstacles, but it&rsquo;s definitely an obstacle. People simply aren&rsquo;t ready for another format, and more importantly, the higher quality formats offer nothing over DVD other than quality, whereas DVD offered a good deal over the previous formats (in order of importance: small form factor, no degradation, improved video quality, easy access to favorite scenes/no rewinding, all DVD players play CDs, and special features).</em></p></blockquote>
