  <div class="entry-content"><p>To celebrate my new employment, Stacey and I bought the Xbox 360 we had planned on putting on our second HDTV. This 360 is all hers.</p>

<p>Stacey has now gotten to the point where she is competant with the dual-stick aiming of console shooters, and the two of us have begun a tour of duty in Rainbow Six: Vegas. Once you give my wonderful 1st grade teaching wife a gun, she settles for nothing less than headshots.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, I now have a job. I&rsquo;m working part-time at a company that provides services for insurance agents. My duties are primarily data entry, which is fine by me. It&rsquo;s low key and not mentally taxing, which was important for me so that I wouldn&rsquo;t feel mentally burned out from work and not be willing to throw my brain into my master&rsquo;s project.</p>

<p>The best part is that every work day, I leave Salinas and go to Carmel. Carmel is beautiful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve posted before about Stacey and games. Now that we&rsquo;re married, Stacey&rsquo;s gaming habit is being helped into high gear.</p>

<p>Stacey already loves playing puzzle games (Zuma!), and novel games like Guitar Hero or Katamari Damacy. However, she has long watched me play shooter games with my friends, and it&rsquo;s her turn to get in on that action.</p>

<p>So, the first thing she needs is to master the dual-thumbstick aiming of console shooters. Once you have that skill, you can jump from game to game (and with games like Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2 coming out, we will have games to jump to). Thus begins Stacey&rsquo;s Basic Weapons Training.</p>

<p>Her first game in this training is Halo 2, an easy choice because it has an &ldquo;Easy&rdquo; difficulty setting, so that she can learn without getting wasted instantly a la Rainbow Six. Improvement has been steady, and it won&rsquo;t be long before she finds a comfort zone. It won&rsquo;t be long before she&rsquo;s playing online.</p>

<time datetime="2007-02-17T13:12:44-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 17<span>th</span>, 2007</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been increasingly dissatisfied with Play Magazine in recent months. I grow tired of the constant over-coverage of any anime-licensed game, and the high scores for these often barely-functional pieces of junk.</p>

<p>The last straw, as one might put it, is Dave Halverson&rsquo;s review of Sonic the Hedgehog, another barely-functional game, this one for the Xbox 360.</p>

<p>Most media outlets gave the game a very low score, below a 5 out of 10. Halverson gave the game a 9.5. Now, bucking conventional opinion isn&rsquo;t a crime. However, this, like many other platformer games in the past, reeks of Halverson fanboyism. Halverson later fessed to the fact that his review copy had the same insane loading times that the final game did, yet because he was promised these would be fixed in the final game, he did not account for them in his review. Of course, optimization is among the final processes a piece of software goes through, and reviewing not-quite-complete game code requires taking this into account. Still, some degree of critical thinking is required, rather than taking the promise at face value. Halverson later updated his review, adjusting the score to a still quite laughable 8.5.</p>

<p>Even all of that isn&rsquo;t enough to make me stop reading. Sure, Halverson is entitled to his opinion, even if that opinion is so rose-colored as to be nearly useless to anyone not named Dave Halverson (which is a problem when it comes to reviews). Here is the real problem, in Halverson&rsquo;s updated review:</p>

<blockquote><p>Sonic isnâ€™t for everybodyâ€”itâ€™s for fans. Just as a game like SOCOM or Medal of Honor 10 is for fans. <strong>Iâ€™d give any military FPS a 3-5 tops for the sheer fact that theyâ€™re so very tired, not to mention packed with realistic killingâ€¦which is why I donâ€™t review military FPS titles</strong>. I donâ€™t like them but I respect the opinions of people that do enough not to insult them. <strong>Shame the door doesnâ€™t swing both ways.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>I had to basically pick my jaw up off the floor after reading that. Suddenly, everything makes sense. Although a truly &ldquo;objective&rdquo; review is impossible, as personal opinions and biases will always factor in, any reasonable reviewer (or even game fan) should be able to recognize intrinsic level of quality in a product that isn&rsquo;t necessarily one&rsquo;s favorite genre. A &ldquo;professional&rdquo; reviewer claiming that an entire genre would get no better than &ldquo;a 3-5 tops&rdquo;, and then trying to justify that mentality by saying &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t review them&rdquo; would be a joke if it weren&rsquo;t so unfunny. (I also love the claim that the genre is &ldquo;so very tired&rdquo;, as if 3D platformers like Sonic aren&rsquo;t every bit as &ldquo;tired&rdquo;). As someone who is very soured on Japanese console RPGs, I could not imagine claiming that I would never give such a game a high score just because I don&rsquo;t like the genre. It&rsquo;s not hard to recognize quality. A critic should recognize his own biases, but also recognize a good product even if it&rsquo;s not in line with those personal biases. That would be called &ldquo;being a professional&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s the kicker at the end. Halverson erects a nice straw man by confessing his own biases, and then obliterates it by implying that those who pan Sonic are just biased against it &ndash; but worse, they aren&rsquo;t confessing them and thus are intellectually dishonest.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s become crystal clear that Halverson has no concept of being a professional. Some accuse him of being a hype factory for his precious platformers, regardless of whatever the actual reality of those games may be. I don&rsquo;t know if Halverson deludes himself into buying into his own excitement for the game, or if he truly does like the games as much as he says he does. What is obvious, though, is that he lacks the clear, rational, even-handed critical thought to write reviews that are of use to anyone else. Because, as some forget, that is the point of printed reviews. That is why people spend $5 to buy the magazine &ndash; to get reviews that are useful to THEM, not to read a Dave Halverson love-letter in the guise of a review. A review needs to be informative to the reader. Failing to point out the myriad of flaws and even game-damaging bugs games like Sonic the Hedgehog have make Halverson&rsquo;s reviews a complete failure at what should be their intended purpose: informing potential customers. A game review written for any other purpose is not a review at all.</p>

<p>So, I am voting with my dollars. Once my Play subscription lapses (very soon), that will be the end of that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I performed a little test. I wanted to see how well a DVD upscaled to 1080i looked compared with a non-upscaled DVD, as well as compared with the same thing in true HD.</p>

<p>I took my Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers DVD, and loaded up The Two Towers in HD on demand through Comcast cable.</p>

<p>I played the movie on my Xbox 360 DVD player (480p), on my Philips upscaling DVD (480p upscaled to 1080i), and then the HD Comcast version (1080i).</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the HD version was the most detailed, and the non-upscaled DVD was the least sharp.</p>

<p>Where my interest lied is where the upscaled DVD fell on this spectrum. Happily, it was closer to the HD picture than the non-upscaled DVD picture.</p>

<p>CNet warned that upscaling &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t do miracles&rdquo;, but I was pleased with the marked improvement in sharpness in the upscaled DVD picture. This was especially evident in the menu screen before the movie loaded, where one could view black text on a white-ish background, and really compare the sharpness. The upscaled DVD was much sharper than the non-upscaled DVD, and rivaled the HD picture.</p>

<p>During actual scenes, subtle detail appeared in the HD picture that did not appear (or at least was not as pronounced) in even the upscaled DVD image.</p>

<p>Granted, this test was not perfect &ndash; only the upscaling DVD player was connected via HDMI, the other two devices were connected via component. But HDMI doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean a better picture, either.
It may not do &ldquo;miracles&rdquo;, but this little unscientific test made me glad that I got an upscaling DVD player. It&rsquo;s impressive, and makes me wonder how necessary HD-DVD and Blu-Ray really are (certainly an improvement, but not one that&rsquo;s going to have me replacing my old DVDs anytime soon &ndash; maybe NEXT format war)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Got an HDTV? Then you probably have (or need) some HDMI cables. HDMI cables are the preferred means of connecting video equipment to HD-enabled display devices. They&rsquo;re digital and offer the highest quality available.</p>

<p>Problem is, they&rsquo;re expensive. Unnecessarily expensive. At Best Buy, they start from about $60 and go up from there.</p>

<p>A website called monoPrice.com, however, sells 6&#8217; HDMI cables for about $5.</p>

<p>Five bucks? They have to be crap, right?</p>

<p>Nope. With digital signals, cable &ldquo;quality&rdquo; is less of an issue. But most importantly, there&rsquo;s no reason for HDMI cables to cost $60-100 anyway. High-end video people are used to spending big on cables (which, in the analog days, WAS necessary for top quality), and so cable manufacturers are all too willing to mark cables up high, even if they don&rsquo;t belong at that price.</p>

<p>The people at AVS Forums (a hardcore A/V crowd) love the monoPrice cables.</p>

<p>So, don&rsquo;t get fooled into paying sky-high prices for HDMI or DVI cables. The markups above $10 are just pure profit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Something new I have decided to do with this page is to post things I read online that I find to be insightful, or at least a concise bit of knowledge or opinion found in my travels through the internet ether. Some of them may be obvious to some people, but others may find something of interest in them.
This comes from Jun-Dai from the Criterion forums, on the topic of high-definition video disc (Blu-Ray, HD-DVD) adoption:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>I&rsquo;ll eat my hat if DVD isn&rsquo;t the highest quality home video format in the US with more than 10% adoption for the next five years at least. The format war isn&rsquo;t the biggest of the obstacles, but it&rsquo;s definitely an obstacle. People simply aren&rsquo;t ready for another format, and more importantly, the higher quality formats offer nothing over DVD other than quality, whereas DVD offered a good deal over the previous formats (in order of importance: small form factor, no degradation, improved video quality, easy access to favorite scenes/no rewinding, all DVD players play CDs, and special features).</em></p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;So <em>Legion</em>&rdquo;, you say, &ldquo;tell me something about games!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Happy to.</p>

<p>First off, if you don&rsquo;t own an <strong>Xbox 360</strong>, please remedy that fact now (Ryan! Greg!). The 360 has quickly pushed its way to the center of my gaming world. The number of games both out and coming out for it make it irresistible, especially for online play.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter (Xbox 360):</strong> I played through the single player campaign when it came out. It was pretty good. But I&rsquo;ve recently starting playing it online again. It&rsquo;s pretty sharp, and runs great online (unlike the last Clancy shooter I tried online, Rainbow Six 3).</p>

<p><strong>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (Xbox 360):</strong> I&rsquo;m an Elder Scrolls fan back from Daggerfall, and though Morrowind didn&rsquo;t quite work out for me, this game has. It&rsquo;s a joy just to ride a horse through the lush, green world. I had a problem with this game when I first got it. I didn&rsquo;t like the fact that enemies level up in accordance to your level. I felt like there was no advancing in the game. I even asked, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo;. Eventually, it hit me &ndash; like a non-RPG, the point is to go from one place to another and experience the content. It&rsquo;s funny how we can get hung up on existing conventions and expectations. This is one game worth full price.</p>

<p><strong>Rainbow Six: Vegas (Xbox 360):</strong> This will be my next online shooter. The videos I&rsquo;ve watched look fantastic, and the single-player demo is fun. I hope they&rsquo;ve gotten past the lag issues of the last Rainbow Six I played online.</p>

<p><strong>Gears of War (Xbox 360):</strong> What I&rsquo;ve heard from interviews on podcasts is that this is going to have some great online gameplay twists, but the meat of the game is an awesome sci-fi single player shooter experience. I&rsquo;m dying to play this one.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.everybody-dies.com/screenshots/screenshot3.jpg"><img src="http://www.everybody-dies.com/screenshots/t_screenshot3.jpg" alt="" /></a><strong>Defcon (PC):</strong> Nuclear war is probably one of my favorite topics for entertainment. Defcon scratches that itch. It&rsquo;s a game that &ldquo;simulates&rdquo; nuclear war, played out entirely on a &ldquo;command room&rdquo; world map screen, like something from WarGames. You don&rsquo;t see any realistic graphics, just little insignias representing cities, missile silos, ships, submarines, and everything else needed to wage nuclear war. The premise is simple &ndash; nuke your opponents&#8217; populations to hell while trying to keep as many of yours alive as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Splinter Cell: Double Agent (Xbox 360): </strong>This was the most disappointing single player Splinter Cell ever. It was still good, but not <strong>great</strong> like Chaos Theory. The multiplayer, however, is a new streamlined version of the Splinter Cell &ldquo;spies vs. mercenaries&rdquo; multiplayer that&rsquo;s been part of the series since Pandora Tomorrow. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to get into, but I&rsquo;m not sure how much lasting power it will have.</p>

<p><strong>Club House Games (Nintendo DS):</strong> Do you have a DS? Get this game! It&rsquo;s shockingly good.  It&rsquo;s 42 little card, board, and other touch screen games. Does a game with little versions of poker, blackjack, bowling, chess, backgammon, darts, and some unique mini games like &ldquo;word balloon&rdquo; sound fun? It doesn&rsquo;t? Well, it really is. None of the games are meaty enough to be worth attention by themselves. But a game that sends you jumping from one little game to the next, it actually is the perfect &ldquo;pick up and go&rdquo; DS game. Did I mention it has online play and single-cart local wireless? It&rsquo;s the ultimate DS time killer.</p>

<p><strong>DOOM (Xbox 360):</strong> The original DOOM was released on Xbox Live Arcade. I can&rsquo;t believe how much I&rsquo;ve played that damn game. I&rsquo;ll play multiplayer with anyone else that has it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Lose</strong> is what you do when you&rsquo;re not winning.</p>

<p><strong>Loose</strong> is what something is when it&rsquo;s not tight.</p>

<p>Losing is the process of not winning. Loosing is not a damn word at all.
I&rsquo;d had quite enough of people getting this wrong. It&rsquo;s bad enough on message boards. What has pushed me over the edge now is the fact that the game Splinter Cell: Double Agent incorrectly has &ldquo;loosing&rdquo; in place of EVERY instance of the word &ldquo;losing&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not just a lone typo. It&rsquo;s a localization team that couldn&rsquo;t pass 2nd grade spelling.</p>

<p>If you are reading this, and I&rsquo;m sure very few people are&hellip; please do not get this wrong again. Ever. Please.</p>

<p>She was annoyed when she came over and found that my TiVo has not been recording the late night South Park reruns on UPN the past week.</p>

<p>Because of her, I can not watch Studio 60 or Entourage when they&rsquo;ve been freshly taped &ndash; I must wait for her to come over and watch too.</p>

<p>Every Monday Night, we go out to a pizza place and watch football. She now watches some on Sunday on her own as well &ndash; not a fanatic yet but her football viewing and knowledge increases each season.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s taken 5 years, but slowly and surely Stacey&rsquo;s tastes are being molded and improved. :)</p>
