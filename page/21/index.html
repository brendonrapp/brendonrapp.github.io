  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two weeks left before finals, and counting. Much work to be done in the meantime.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve sacked my desktop computer, and am using my laptop computer plus my desktop LCD in a dual-screen setup. Very neat. Only catch so far is that ATI&rsquo;s video drivers for Linux, fglrx, don&rsquo;t support two displays using different resolutions in Dual Head mode. I get distorted video on the second screen. Yet, if I use Big Desktop mode, it works fine (but I don&rsquo;t want Big Desktop mode, because I want windows to maximize to only one screen).</p>

<p>I recently discovered Microsoft&rsquo;s OneNote software. It&rsquo;s the note-taking software I&rsquo;ve been looking for for years. So I&rsquo;ll be using Windows pretty frequently until I can get OneNote to run in Linux using WINE or Crossover Office or something (maybe I&rsquo;ll go so far as to set up a VMWare environment, though I&rsquo;d prefer something without so much overhead).</p>

<p>I have to say, Windows has managed to be very tolerable for me, thanks to some of the software I&rsquo;ve been using to keep it hassle free. I just wish I didn&rsquo;t need to always commit so much RAM to virus protection and spyware protection and so on.</p>

<p>Just installed Ubuntu back onto this machine. The &ldquo;kubuntu&rdquo; packages give me a KDE desktop in Ubuntu without so much hassle, though the packages still have a ways to go. Lots of improvements on the Ubuntu front &ndash; it could conceivably end up as my &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; distro.</p>

<time datetime="2005-04-07T17:02:30-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 7<span>th</span>, 2005</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve finished the single-player mode of Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. The series ranks among my very favorites, so as you can imagine, I had a good time with this game. A little bit of the &ldquo;wow&rdquo; factor has been lost along the way, given that this is the third game in the same console generation. It is, however, probably the most well-executed one. If there&rsquo;s disappointment, it would be merely that it does not blow the last offering, Pandora Tomorrow, out of the water. Given that Pandora Tomorrow was a superb game that was denied sufficient &ldquo;Game of the Year&rdquo; opportunities thanks to its early-year release (the game that impressed you 8 months ago doesn&rsquo;t quite maintain the same &ldquo;bang&rdquo; as the game that impressed you two weeks ago), one can&rsquo;t exactly take that as a very negative statement. Chaos Theory&rsquo;s missions were consistantly good, but perhaps not as inspired as the very best of Pandora Tomorrow&rsquo;s offerings (but probably more consistant across the board).</p>

<p>Another disappointment, though, would be the loss of Dennis Haysbert (from <em>24</em>, <em>Major League</em>, and the All-State commercials) as the voice of Irving Lambert. The actor that played the role in the original game returns. He&rsquo;s good, but nowhere near as powerful and commanding of a voice as Haysbert. Some of the other voice actors aren&rsquo;t so good, though. The core characters (all returning actors from previous versrions) are great, but a few of the characters you encounter in the field could be a lot better. I guess it&rsquo;s nice when you can be picky about the voices of small part characters &ndash; only because the major characters are so good.</p>

<p>The inclusion of an excellent co-op mode, as well as the return and improvement of the &ldquo;spies vs. mercenaries&rdquo; mode introduced in Pandora Tomorrow, really pushes Chaos Theory to the top.</p>

<p>Reportedly, the next Splinter Cell game will be on both the current AND the next-generation consoles. Splinter Cell represents some of the best of the current generation&rsquo;s technology, and is a prime choice to showcase the next gen&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m worried, though, that the next game won&rsquo;t take full advantage of the power of the next-gen consoles, if it also has to be ported to the current systems. Apparently the next game will be done by Ubisoft Shanghai, who did Pandora Tomorrow (Ubisoft Montreal did the original and Chaos Theory). The tag-team approach of having each developer do every other Splinter Cell game is unique, and so far, quite effective. It lets Ubi keep the Splinter Cell games coming, while giving them each enough development time to be A-level titles.</p>

<p>I plan to be playing this game on Xbox Live for some time to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post has nothing to do with girls, but I put it on that category just as an excuse to show the Rachael Leigh Cook icon for this category (if you&rsquo;re reading on LJ or Xanga, follow the link at the bottom of this post to my site)&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve finally started going back to work and class. My throat&rsquo;s still raw, but my energy&rsquo;s (mostly) back.</p>

<p>My birthday is Friday. I&rsquo;ve got a laptop coming. Waving bye-bye to my Powerbook won&rsquo;t be easy. Kids, unless you&rsquo;re playing a bunch of computer games (or learning to develop them), get yourself a nice Apple computer. There ain&rsquo;t no reason to be usin&#8217; no Windows systems if you&rsquo;re just web browsing and word processing.</p>

<p>Halo 2 is starting to get underneath my skin. It&rsquo;s so easy to just hop on and within a minute, be in an online game. My dad wants an Xbox and Halo 2. He&rsquo;s turning 51 in May and he&rsquo;s wanting an Xbox. That&rsquo;s my pops.</p>

<p>Now, to stare at my wonderful icon&hellip;..</p>

<p>I took a trip to <a href="http://www.bevmo.com/">Beverages &amp; More</a> yesterday, and decided to get a few of their funky sodas. Among the group was this citrusy communist delight. The bottle&rsquo;s label spouts phrases like &ldquo;Drink Comrade, Drink! It&rsquo;s this or the Gulag!&rdquo;, and the cap is suitably labeled &ldquo;CCCP&rdquo;. As for the drink itself, it&rsquo;s a lightly flavored soda. It&rsquo;s got some citrus and berry flavor, and is apparently made from real sugar cane. It certainly features more pomp than kick, but its style points are well-earned.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that the <a href="http://www.leninade.com">product&rsquo;s website</a> features the Leninade Girls. Although such a thing seems to smack of capitalist marketing. Not sure how such inconsistancies are justified. I suppose it&rsquo;s a capitalist&rsquo;s world, and communism has to use capitalism&rsquo;s mechanisms against it in order to get anywhere these days. But such things aren&rsquo;t meant for such close examination! Drink, comrade!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve torn myself away from <a href="http://www.ffmastermind.com/quickbits.php">monitoring the NFL news wire for free agency news</a> long enough to actually post&hellip;</p>

<p>I finished Knights of the Old Republic II a few days ago. About a day later, a storm of activity online formed as it was discovered that <a href="http://forums.obsidianent.com/index.php?showtopic=29764&amp;st=0">the PC version includes removed dialogue text &amp; audio</a> of a longer, more substantial ending. Presumably, the material may be on the Xbox version as well, but it&rsquo;s much more difficult to dig through the game files than it is on a PC game. Naturally, people with nothing better to do with their time have labeled it some kind of travesty. My thoughts? People get far too hung up on &ldquo;endings&rdquo;. 30 hours of game and story development aren&rsquo;t made or broken by a 5 minute final cutscene. And when something gets cut, it gets cut for a reason. The people who bitch and moan when stuff gets cut are the same ones who bitch and moan when things <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> cut, making the game take longer to come out. Little Billy 14-year-old has no idea about software development.</p>

<p>After finishing Knights, I started in on Prince of Persia: Warrior Within. I began this game with the understanding that the direction of the game is very different from the beloved previous game, The Sands of Time (which easily makes my Top 10, and perhaps my Top 5 list, for best games of all time). Even still, there&rsquo;s an initial shock to get over. While The Sands of Time was charming and ethereal, Warrior Within is grungy and a bit shameless. The magic is gone, and a heavy metal video is in its place. Not that I can&rsquo;t tolerate that. I watch Headbanger&rsquo;s Ball and sometimes Uranium. But when the old game was near perfect, it&rsquo;s hard to accept a new approach that&rsquo;s all about marketing to 15-year-old boys in stained Slipknot shirts. The <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2004-12-03">evil broad wears a steel thong and the prince smolders with generic rage</a>. It&rsquo;s a good game regardless, but it&rsquo;s not as good as it could have been.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been sick since last Thursday night. I&rsquo;ve had a nice cough going for a week so far. Today, it eased up a bit during the day, but anytime I start talking, it flares up again. So I&rsquo;ve been rather silent for the past few days, as you might imagine.</p>

<p>I have continued to play Knights of the Old Republic II on the Xbox. I would really appreciate it if the game would stop freezing and making me lose progress.</p>

<p>I also picked up a copy of Frequency, and a copy of Amplitude &ndash; two rhythm-based music games that are quite a blast to play. I think of them less as competitive games and more as enjoyable experiences. Your button-presses activate a certain track in the song (a drum track, a synth track, etc), and you essentially mix it together on the fly. Very creative.</p>

<p><a href="http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/590/590306p1.html">Battlestar Galactica was picked up for a second season</a>. Good news for fans of intelligent sci-fi.</p>

<p>Sony and Zipper Interactive have <a href="http://ps2.ign.com/articles/590/590290p1.html">finally, finally announced SOCOM III</a>, due out in Q3 of this year. The new game will feature player-usable vehicles, as well as swimming (for water-based landing zones a la the movie &ldquo;The Rock&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m sure). Also coming over the news wire is a <a href="http://ps2.ign.com/articles/590/590383p1.html">follow-up story indicating SOCOM III will feature maps up to 6 times larger than previous games</a>, thanks to &ldquo;a specialized streaming environmental technology&rdquo;. After months of speculation, it&rsquo;s finally nice to get an official SOCOM announcement, and some sweet looking new features to boot. One news article calls the game &ldquo;the PlayStation 2&rsquo;s online swan song&rdquo;. It will most likely be the last great online PS2 game. I hope they cook something up for the release of the PS3, even if it is something akin to &ldquo;SOCOM 3.5&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Halo 2 will keep me busy until then. Would be nice to see some new Halo 2 maps soon.</p>
