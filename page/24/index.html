  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>The theme of the last few days: fatigue.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have been TIRED. It&rsquo;s way too early to be school semester rundown. I just hit a spell of fatigue, I guess. I was so tired last night. I went to bed before 11:00. And even today, I&rsquo;m tired and lethargic. I had planned on staying up late last night to finish my C SCI 112 assignment (due tomorrow &ndash; Monday), but I&rsquo;ll do that tonight instead.</p>

<p>The only thing I really remember doing on Friday was checking the Costco here in Clovis for TVs. They didn&rsquo;t have what I want. Then I got a call from Stacey, telling me that she didn&rsquo;t have to babysit that night. So, she came over and hung out. We picked up Bobby Salazar&rsquo;s, played Day of the Tentacle, and watched TV. It was fun.</p>

<p>On Saturday, I got up at 7:00am, got showered and dressed, picked up Stacey, and we went and watched my brother&rsquo;s tennis tournament. After that, we shopped for my TV until finally finding one that I wanted (and that would fit in my entertainment center). We got it home, and then everybody (myself, Stacey, my parents and brother) all sat down and watched the first part of the Fresno State/Oregon State game. It was ugly to start, and it got REAL ugly later. Everyone left after a while, leaving me all alone. Then Derek came over for about an hour. We played a couple quick games, and then he left.</p>

<p>Today, I went to breakfast with my parents (who were in town for the 2nd half of Logan&rsquo;s tournament). After that, I checked out CompUSA to see what kind of MP3 players they had. I then went home, and ordered one from Amazon.com instead. I got the Archos Jukebox Recorder 20GB player. I really, really thought about getting the Apple iPod instead. I really wanted to. But Apple, once again, has priced themselves out of competition. Archos&rsquo;s 20GB player was $225. Apple&rsquo;s 5GB player was $299, and their 20GB player was $499. If their 20GB player had been $299, I would have gone for it. But for 5GB? No way. Apple&rsquo;s player is the best, hands down, but not for <em>that</em> price.</p>

<p>Football on TV (football&rsquo;s so much cooler on a big, flat, sharp screen). Gotta finish enjoying the day of football before dealing with my programming assignment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>You know, if instructors are given choice parking &ndash; much closer to classes than student parking is &ndash; then the least they could do is show up on time. As students, we&rsquo;re expected to be on time daily, and we have to fend for ourselves in the jungle of parking here on campus (where the cars easily outnumber the parking spaces). Instructors that can&rsquo;t show up on time ought to be banished to the student lots. If they&rsquo;re gonna be late anyway, might as well make them go through our daily hassle.</p></blockquote>

<p>Surprise, surprise, C SCI 60&rsquo;s homework due date has been pushed back to Wednesday. The instructor uploaded it but forgot to update the links on the class website. This was posted online last night.</p>

<p>Went to my parents house yesterday, to watch the Jaguars slap the Kansas City Chiefs around a bit. Also played NFL2K3 against my brother, and mopped the floor with him: 60-6. To his credit, he used a team that was rated close to mine (his Texans were ranked 31st, my Jags 29th), instead of using a much more highly rated squad. My manually-controlled cover skills are starting to approach my old NFL2K1 abilities, as I was often swarming around the ball, knocking down passes on my own. The way my pass coverage works is that I call a number of zone coverages. I use a player &ndash; typically the MLB &ndash; whose zone assignment is the center of the field. I maintain this zone until I know there is no real threat coming into my zone. Then, I vacate my zone and make a play on a receiver. It&rsquo;s hard for opponents to throw away from me, because my delayed pursuit gives them little time to react &ndash; if they wait until I pick my coverage, they&rsquo;ll have a pass-rush in their face. Plus, sometimes I just drop back into a deeper center zone, and try to make a play on the ball after it&rsquo;s been thrown. I&rsquo;m happy my pass coverage is starting to come around. I wasn&rsquo;t making any plays when I first got the game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Last week, I broke the big toe on my right foot. On the same day, I also went through hell with a dead car battery. (As one might surmise, the latter led to the former). After multiple visits to car places, and multiple visits to the university health center, my car is back up and running, and my toe is taped up and (allegedly) in the process of healing. I am staying mobile using crutches and a wheelchair. It&rsquo;s no fun, but I am supposed to be able to start walking again after about a week after injury (so, later this week). We&rsquo;ll see.</p></blockquote>

<p>Anyway, the Jacksonville Jaguars and Fresno State Bulldog football teams both lost games that they should have won. The former lost due to a couple of key mental mistakes, the latter due to blatently pro-Oregon calls by the officials (so blatent that ESPN announcer Warren Moon, who has no vested interest in Fresno State, was shocked). In better news, the NFL expansion franchise Houston Texans (led by former Fresno State quarterback David Carr) won their opener against an improved Dallas Cowboys franchise.</p>

<p>Last night, I went to a wedding with Stacey. The wedding was of one of Stacey&rsquo;s oldest friends. It was enjoyable. I was on crutches at the service, and in the wheelchair at the reception. The highlight of the evening was when I wheeled myself out onto the floor for the tossing of the garter, stood up on my one good leg, and plucked the garter out of the air with my left hand. There was no bobbling, no unsteady hand. It was a solid, firm catch with my non-dominant hand. All were impressed, as I sat back down into my chair with wheels, and rolled myself back towards Stacey and the dinner table. Stace just shook her head and snapped a picture of me, holding my prize.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve helped Stacey build her website. I&rsquo;ll put it in my links section as soon as I finish putting that section together. Her site has pictures from the wedding.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Been a while since I posted (don&rsquo;t most of my posts start with that line?).  So what&rsquo;s happened musically as of late?</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>Linkin Park &ndash; In addition to &ldquo;In the End&rdquo;, I also like &ldquo;Crawling&rdquo;.  I have received much ridicule from the music snob circles. :)</p></li>
<li><p>Kylie Minogue &ndash; Damn you, Kelly. Damn you for making me download &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Get You Out of My Head&rdquo;. Now I&rsquo;ve seen the music video too. It&rsquo;s more than I dare to think about.</p></li>
<li><p>METAL &ndash; Metal, metal, metal, MEEETALLL. Fates Warning, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Queensrÿche, TOOL, Spiral Architect, Dream Theater, Neurosis, Therion, Black Sabbath, and I need more. I&rsquo;ve had to use some hard-rock (even The Who) for more fix. I&rsquo;ve been in a major metal mood. I think some later Iron Maiden would be cool. This one (<em>The Number of the Beast</em>) is a bit silly at times. The style is great but maybe some of the cheesiness is left off on later albums. <em>Powerslave</em> is next on my Maiden to-get list.</p></li>
<li><p>Krautrock &ndash; My Faust box set is always nearby. I recently got Can&rsquo;s <em>Ege Bamyasi</em>, downloaded some Electric Mud and Amon Düül II.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>It seems one of my friends and one of my online music buds are conspiring against me. And my friend&rsquo;s trying to drag my girl into it too. Like I told her (the friend), with friends like these, who needs enemies? I gotta admit, though, it&rsquo;s WAY more fun than last semester when I didn&rsquo;t really know anyone around here.</p>

<p>Ooh, and my best friend is coming to Fresno next semester after spending this semester in Monterey. Now maybe I&rsquo;ll finally be able to teach him an instrument.  Hmm, I&rsquo;m getting a bigger apartment now too&hellip; I should take my brother&rsquo;s drum kit (The World&rsquo;s Least Used Drum Set).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also playing my guitars far more than before, even writing some music. Usually when I&rsquo;m supposed to be doing homework. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>So, what&rsquo;s happened between my last post and now? Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you&hellip; CLASSES started. WORK started. Bluh&#8217;y hell. Let&rsquo;s review Hell, CSU Fresno style:</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>First level of Hell:</strong> Work.  Work requires me being up at 6:00am every morning (yes, it takes me that long to get to an 8:00 job, and yes, it&rsquo;s still a struggle to be on time). Work isn&rsquo;t as bad as it was last semester, as I&rsquo;m alone in the office now and I&rsquo;ll have my own Ethernet connection, and can play my own music (albeit at low volume levels)&hellip;. but I&rsquo;m still being given the same pointless crap to do.  If my job only revolved around PRODUCTIVE work, I&rsquo;d have two free hours a day. :)</p>

<p><strong>Second level of Hell:</strong> Women&rsquo;s Studies 110.  Representations of Women.  Male Bashing 101.  Let&rsquo;s put it this way&hellip; I would wipe my arse with this week&rsquo;s readings, but I fear for rectal infection. Making matters worse is an instructor that lacks organization.</p>

<p><strong>Third level of Hell:</strong> Computer Science 41.  Introduction to Data Structures.  Now, CompSci is fun. Programming is fun.  But this class is the class that weeds people out of the CompSci major. The highest dropout rate of any lower-division class in the university.  In the entire university.  Over 70% dropout rate. Some people take the class with a clean schedule &ndash; no other classes.  Well, I need to pass it this semester. Need only pass.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth level of Hell:</strong> Math 76.  Calculus. A repeat. It was crappy before. It promises to live up to last semester&rsquo;s crappiness.</p>

<p><strong>Fifth level of Hell:</strong> Economics in Film.  Looks to actually be a decent class. Only bad things: it&rsquo;s from 6-9pm, and it&rsquo;ll run late some nights&hellip; that&rsquo;s LONG. Plus, the room we&rsquo;re going to watch the movies in don&rsquo;t allow food, so no munchies during the films. Like, what&rsquo;s up with that?</p>

<p><strong>Sixth level of Hell:</strong> History of Rock and Jazz.  Only thing about this class is that I need to officially get into it (gotta show up tonight &ndash; the first class session). Another 6-9pm night class, but this one shouldn&rsquo;t run late like the film class will. The hard part about night classes is taking them seriously &ndash; it&rsquo;s not easy to pay attention to academics at that hour.</p>

<p>So basically, things at the University suck. As they do at most academic institutions, I would imagine. Keeping nice company after work/school hours makes it much more tolerable, though.</p>

<p>My next post will include some actual music content.</p>
