<p>Thanks to a few hours of coding tonight/this morning, I now have my project in a &ldquo;completed&rdquo; state.</p>

<p>What that means is that I have a binary and source code that I could turn in.</p>

<p>I still have a couple of days to implement any new features that I might see fit to. Although I just may go ahead and consider this &ldquo;finished&rdquo; and present it to class tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll decide in the morning.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, Derek and Logan came to crash at the apartment yesterday. We spent most of the day shopping and playing at the nickel arcade (which has added a number of games since the last time I went, and vastly improved the &ldquo;free play&rdquo; offerings). We spent $2 in there, and about $2 each on constant gameplay for the next 2 hours or so. Usually you go into an arcade and blow $5 in about 15 minutes. :) It&rsquo;s nice for those of us that can get a kick out of a mix of yesteryear&rsquo;s games and some classics (Super Off Road was awesome).</p>

<p>Anyway, at my request, Derek brought his Apple laptop (15&#8221; PowerBook G4). I played around with it, and got a little more familiar with OS X. I was happy when I got myself to a command line. :) Spending a little while on it helped fully &ldquo;sell&rdquo; me on the Apple.</p>

<p>Got very little done for my project Saturday and today. I&rsquo;m working on it now. I need to make it feature-complete pretty much by the end of tomorrow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>My PS2 game collection has increased by three (well, sorta).</p></blockquote>

<p>I went to Software Etc. and bought a used copy of ICO for $19.99. I also got a used PSX memory card.</p>

<p>Later, Derek and Shelby came over (for like 15 minutes &ndash; F1 racing was coming on, and they had to go watch) and Derek brought his copies of Metal Gear Solid 2 and Dark Cloud for me to borrow. Excellent.</p>

<p>Shelby asked &ldquo;which beanbag is it that Stacey says is hers and nobody else can sit in it?&rdquo;. I told her it was the gray one. She then grabbed that beanbag and sat down in it.</p>

<p>I also got my DirecTV equipment today. Satellite TV pending soon&hellip;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Jacksonville&rsquo;s defense was nowhere to be found today. That, paired with a head shot taken by Brunell, led to a Jaguars loss. :(</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Finished installing my wireless network yesterday. My wireless router is now handling all my routing duties, rather than my FreeBSD box. Is this because I thought the hardware router would be better? No, it&rsquo;s because I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to make the router act as only a wireless access point. I must say, it is easier to administrate the SMC Barricade than it is FreeBSD <em>ipnat</em> (though I got pretty handy at typing &ldquo;vi /etc/ipnat.rules&rdquo; and &ldquo;ipnat -CF -f /etc/ipnat.rules&rdquo;).</p></blockquote>

<p>So, anyway, Stacey and I went to the fair today. The food was good. Don&rsquo;t ask me how I managed to avoid eating the barbecue ribs, though. Just never had time to sit down and eat them. Pizza and nachos and snowcones are edible on the move. Anyway, the Michelle Branch concert was fun. Granted, pop music isn&rsquo;t my style, but I prefer Branch&rsquo;s style of music over the whiz-bang of so-called &ldquo;bubblegum pop&rdquo;. At least it&rsquo;s honest, and not manufactured. So I was able to enjoy myself. I&rsquo;m still far more looking forward to hearing TOOL play, naturally, but this was enjoyable. Stacey and I took some pictures &ndash; they&rsquo;ll be on each of our sites eventually.</p>

<p>Driving down to Porterville tomorrow to watch the football games tomorrow. A nice way to cap off a fun weekend. I needed a good weekend too, because the exam studying starts again on Monday (my C SCI 112 assembly language exam is on Friday, and it&rsquo;s going to be TOUGH. I have SO much studying to do for it).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>JAGUARS WIN, 28-3!</p></blockquote>

<p>(The real Jaguars this time, not my NFL2K3 team).</p>

<p>I read an interesting story on <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/01/01/25/1343218.shtml">Slashdot</a> about DirecTV hacking, and I saw a comment that made me think. It read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>Economics is how to allocate scare resources amoung various competing consumers.</strong> Technology enables us to achieve an almost utopian state with some products, 0% scarcity. These companies are trying to apply old-world economics to new-world goods and servicies by creating an artificial scarcity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting point. With a technology like satellite, there is no scarcity of the resource. The only thing that keeps prices what they are is artificial measures and controls applied to &ldquo;lock&rdquo; this technology.</p>

<p>Anyway, I went to Porterville today to watch the football games. It was fun watching the Jags pound on the hapless Jets. I took some of my books too, but I didn&rsquo;t really spend much time with them. I&rsquo;m staying up tonight to try and code a couple of these algorithms&hellip; if I can do that, it will cut my workload leading into Wednesday&rsquo;s tests by a good measure.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a little burned out right now, and it&rsquo;s not really a good time to be burned out. I have to get through these tests, and then two more midterms next week. After that, I will probably go &ldquo;splat&rdquo; for a week. It&rsquo;s just a never-ending workload, which seems to self-replicate much more rapidly than any other semester of work.</p>

<p>My toe is feeling mostly good, except if I bump it. Like the doctor indicated, it will be tender for a little while longer.</p>

<p>My handicap parking pass expires at the end of this week. Bummer. I rather enjoyed the choice parking. Maybe I should hurt myself again&hellip;.</p>

<p>This Saturday, I&rsquo;m taking Stacey to see Michelle Branch at the Fresno Fair. I need to go to a pop/rock or jazz concert for my music class, and she likes Michelle Branch, and the tickets were pretty cheap, so it seemed like a good move on all fronts. Should be fun, even if I&rsquo;m not really a fan of the style of music. I can think of far worse ways to spend an evening.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. I&rsquo;m tired, but the night is still young.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>The theme of the last few days: fatigue.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have been TIRED. It&rsquo;s way too early to be school semester rundown. I just hit a spell of fatigue, I guess. I was so tired last night. I went to bed before 11:00. And even today, I&rsquo;m tired and lethargic. I had planned on staying up late last night to finish my C SCI 112 assignment (due tomorrow &ndash; Monday), but I&rsquo;ll do that tonight instead.</p>

<p>The only thing I really remember doing on Friday was checking the Costco here in Clovis for TVs. They didn&rsquo;t have what I want. Then I got a call from Stacey, telling me that she didn&rsquo;t have to babysit that night. So, she came over and hung out. We picked up Bobby Salazar&rsquo;s, played Day of the Tentacle, and watched TV. It was fun.</p>

<p>On Saturday, I got up at 7:00am, got showered and dressed, picked up Stacey, and we went and watched my brother&rsquo;s tennis tournament. After that, we shopped for my TV until finally finding one that I wanted (and that would fit in my entertainment center). We got it home, and then everybody (myself, Stacey, my parents and brother) all sat down and watched the first part of the Fresno State/Oregon State game. It was ugly to start, and it got REAL ugly later. Everyone left after a while, leaving me all alone. Then Derek came over for about an hour. We played a couple quick games, and then he left.</p>

<p>Today, I went to breakfast with my parents (who were in town for the 2nd half of Logan&rsquo;s tournament). After that, I checked out CompUSA to see what kind of MP3 players they had. I then went home, and ordered one from Amazon.com instead. I got the Archos Jukebox Recorder 20GB player. I really, really thought about getting the Apple iPod instead. I really wanted to. But Apple, once again, has priced themselves out of competition. Archos&rsquo;s 20GB player was $225. Apple&rsquo;s 5GB player was $299, and their 20GB player was $499. If their 20GB player had been $299, I would have gone for it. But for 5GB? No way. Apple&rsquo;s player is the best, hands down, but not for <em>that</em> price.</p>

<p>Football on TV (football&rsquo;s so much cooler on a big, flat, sharp screen). Gotta finish enjoying the day of football before dealing with my programming assignment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>You know, if instructors are given choice parking &ndash; much closer to classes than student parking is &ndash; then the least they could do is show up on time. As students, we&rsquo;re expected to be on time daily, and we have to fend for ourselves in the jungle of parking here on campus (where the cars easily outnumber the parking spaces). Instructors that can&rsquo;t show up on time ought to be banished to the student lots. If they&rsquo;re gonna be late anyway, might as well make them go through our daily hassle.</p></blockquote>

<p>Surprise, surprise, C SCI 60&rsquo;s homework due date has been pushed back to Wednesday. The instructor uploaded it but forgot to update the links on the class website. This was posted online last night.</p>

<p>Went to my parents house yesterday, to watch the Jaguars slap the Kansas City Chiefs around a bit. Also played NFL2K3 against my brother, and mopped the floor with him: 60-6. To his credit, he used a team that was rated close to mine (his Texans were ranked 31st, my Jags 29th), instead of using a much more highly rated squad. My manually-controlled cover skills are starting to approach my old NFL2K1 abilities, as I was often swarming around the ball, knocking down passes on my own. The way my pass coverage works is that I call a number of zone coverages. I use a player &ndash; typically the MLB &ndash; whose zone assignment is the center of the field. I maintain this zone until I know there is no real threat coming into my zone. Then, I vacate my zone and make a play on a receiver. It&rsquo;s hard for opponents to throw away from me, because my delayed pursuit gives them little time to react &ndash; if they wait until I pick my coverage, they&rsquo;ll have a pass-rush in their face. Plus, sometimes I just drop back into a deeper center zone, and try to make a play on the ball after it&rsquo;s been thrown. I&rsquo;m happy my pass coverage is starting to come around. I wasn&rsquo;t making any plays when I first got the game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Last week, I broke the big toe on my right foot. On the same day, I also went through hell with a dead car battery. (As one might surmise, the latter led to the former). After multiple visits to car places, and multiple visits to the university health center, my car is back up and running, and my toe is taped up and (allegedly) in the process of healing. I am staying mobile using crutches and a wheelchair. It&rsquo;s no fun, but I am supposed to be able to start walking again after about a week after injury (so, later this week). We&rsquo;ll see.</p></blockquote>

<p>Anyway, the Jacksonville Jaguars and Fresno State Bulldog football teams both lost games that they should have won. The former lost due to a couple of key mental mistakes, the latter due to blatently pro-Oregon calls by the officials (so blatent that ESPN announcer Warren Moon, who has no vested interest in Fresno State, was shocked). In better news, the NFL expansion franchise Houston Texans (led by former Fresno State quarterback David Carr) won their opener against an improved Dallas Cowboys franchise.</p>

<p>Last night, I went to a wedding with Stacey. The wedding was of one of Stacey&rsquo;s oldest friends. It was enjoyable. I was on crutches at the service, and in the wheelchair at the reception. The highlight of the evening was when I wheeled myself out onto the floor for the tossing of the garter, stood up on my one good leg, and plucked the garter out of the air with my left hand. There was no bobbling, no unsteady hand. It was a solid, firm catch with my non-dominant hand. All were impressed, as I sat back down into my chair with wheels, and rolled myself back towards Stacey and the dinner table. Stace just shook her head and snapped a picture of me, holding my prize.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve helped Stacey build her website. I&rsquo;ll put it in my links section as soon as I finish putting that section together. Her site has pictures from the wedding.</p>
