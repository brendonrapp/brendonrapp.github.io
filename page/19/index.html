  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fantasy football has begun. 3 day weekend, 3 drafts for me. The &ldquo;real life&rdquo; league that I&rsquo;ve run for years now, and two online leagues based around the GamersWithJobs.com website.</p>

<p>Stacey has joined our &ldquo;real life&rdquo; league for the first time. She got her first taste of a fantasy football draft.</p>

<p>Today, she informed me that she&rsquo;s worried about one of her players, Titans running back Chris Brown &ndash; whom she has learned is injury-prone.</p>

<p>I love her so much.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the last few hours, I have been upgrading my little file server / router, APOLLO, to Linux kernel 2.6. I&rsquo;ve been running it at 2.4 long enough.</p>

<p>APOLLO is a little Celeron 466, 128MB RAM machine, with a 10GB drive for the OS (Gentoo Linux) and two 120GB drives for my music collection &amp; other files.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also working on implementing traffic shaping with <em>iptables</em> and <em>iproute2</em> (tc), to help prioritize online gaming packets (much like those hardware &ldquo;gaming routers&rdquo; on the market). Have had some success so far. APOLLO&rsquo;s quite the old trooper, and it&rsquo;s time for him to learn a few new tricks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&rsquo;t really wanted to post in a while, mainly because I didn&rsquo;t care to move those Shirley Manson pictures off the top of the page. I am of the mind that an attractive female gripping her own chest is, how you say, <em>hot.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve teetered between indifference and addiction in World of Warcraft, sometimes going back and forth in the same day. At its best, World of Warcraft is a very enjoyable virtual online world to be in. I&rsquo;m convinced that more people could force themselves through the daily grind of real life more readily if they were awarded experience points every step of the way, and created social castes around a person&rsquo;s <em>level</em>. Although such a system could easily be considered an allegory for how things really are, albeit one much more transparent (and in our world, some bastards are just <em>born</em> into Level 50)</p>

<p>My virtual Jacksonville Jaguars continue to dominate the playing field in their online league, standing at 7-0. My first team offense is getting less and less field time, as I want to keep Byron Leftwich and Fred Taylor healthy for the postseason.</p>

<p>NHL hockey has been <em>NUTS</em> since the lockout ended. The Kings now have Pavol Demitra, Jeremy Roenick, and Valeri Bure to add to Craig Conroy, Alexander Frolov, Luc Robitaille, Dustin Brown, and Mike Cammalleri to choose top 6 forwards from. Definitely better scoring depth than they&rsquo;ve had in a while, though I miss Jason Allison. Hopefully Cammy and Brown can challenge Bure and Robitaille for 2nd line time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m knee deep in NFL preseason football, watching virtually every game on tape delay. It&rsquo;s time to prepare for football season. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My flight is now booked for Austin, TX, to attend the <a href="http://www.gameconference.com">Austin Game Conference</a> on October 27-28.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to returning to Austin. My time there a few weeks ago wasn&rsquo;t much beyond driving around the city and seeing what&rsquo;s there. Although I&rsquo;ll see even less of the city this time, I will be staying downtown and walking to the Conference at the convention center.</p>

<p>Between this and the Game Developer&rsquo;s Conference in San Jose (next March), I&rsquo;ll be able to attend at least two trade conferences before finishing school. Maybe I&rsquo;ll find a couple of non-game development conferences to attend as well. As much as I would like to be able to work in Austin, I have to be open to going anywhere in the country. Eventually I&rsquo;ll earn the right to pick and choose where I go, and I&rsquo;ll probably work my way back towards Austin if I&rsquo;m not there already. But until then, as much as Stacey doesn&rsquo;t want to hear it, anywhere is a possibility. San Francisco, Seattle, San Jose, New York, Boston, Vancouver, Montreal, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Chicago, Portland, Houston, San Diego? Anywhere and everywhere are possibilities, though the three most likely places are California (Bay/LA/San Diego), Washington (Seattle/Redmond), and Texas (Austin/San Antonio/Houston).</p>

<p>But when you&rsquo;re starting at the bottom, you have to go where the work is. Choosing where to go is a luxury earned later.</p>

<time datetime="2005-07-11T17:00:31-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 11<span>th</span>, 2005</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>GameFly brought me a pair of new Xbox releases in the form of Destroy All Humans! and Conker: Live and Reloaded.</p>

<p>Destroy All Humans is a tale of a great game that wasn&rsquo;t quite. I am reminded of a quote from someone on the Halo development team, who talked about how the core of one&rsquo;s game boils down to 30 seconds of gameplay. Those 30 seconds you will experience over and over again. In Halo&rsquo;s case, for example, those 30 seconds contain shooting, dodging, and piloting vehicles. You play those same 30 seconds over and over &ndash; the locations and context change, but the actions remain largely the same. So, the Halo dev&rsquo;s point was, you have to nail those 30 seconds to make a great game.</p>

<p>Destroy All Humans nails the 30 seconds, but proves that it takes more than just that to make a great game. There is sheer gameplay joy to find in Destroy All Humans. Your alien character is capable of, among other things, lifting and throwing creatures, people, and objects telekinetically. There&rsquo;s an aspect of thrilling discovery involved when you find that, yes, you CAN lift the guy up and repeatedly slam him into the ground to kill him. Or, lift him waaaaaaay up and let go, and just let gravity do the rest. And, one might say that you haven&rsquo;t truly [i]lived[/i] until you have telekinetically thrown a cow (radioactive or otherwise) at your attackers and let the bovine&rsquo;s mass do the dirty work.</p>

<p>Sadly, while the core gameplay is a blast, the game doesn&rsquo;t provide a varied enough framework for it. Occasionally, you get to enjoy some real ingenious sequences (such as taking on the appearance of a town&rsquo;s mayor, and speaking to the townspeople to calm their fears&hellip; that is, if you choose dialogue options like &ldquo;Blame Communists&rdquo; and resist the temptation of ones such as &ldquo;Enslave Human Populace&rdquo;). Most of the time, however, you&rsquo;re doing the same sorts of tasks over and over, and getting shot at by one too many offscreen enemies. As the game ramps up the challenge, it forgets that the feeling of being a near-indestructable badass alien is what makes the game fun. When the enemies are capable of putting up too frantic of a fight to allow you to enjoy the fun of your abilities, things get less interesting.</p>

<p>As for Conker, well, there&rsquo;s one beautiful looking game. Infuriatingly, however, the camera control issues of the original game are still largely present. Also present is the fact that the game is, by and large, a platformer &ndash; and despite my love of the witty yet horribly crude humor, I found that I still don&rsquo;t enjoy 3D platformers very much. Except for Psychonauts, though Psychonauts managed to be as much of a 3D action/adventure game as it was a platformer.</p>

<p>Anyway, both games are going back in the mail tomorrow. I might try Conker again in the future, but right now there are some new releases that are a bit more up my alley that I want to get my hands on&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been playing Baseball Stars. On my PSP.</p>

<p>And frankly, that&rsquo;s just cool.</p>

<p>Thanks to some dedicated PSP hackers, owners of PSP with 1.50 firmware or older can execute unsigned code that has been copied to a memory stick. Emulator developers jumped all over that and have released their emulators for the PSP.</p>

<p>So far, I have tried NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and Super NES emulation (I&rsquo;ll be giving the Sega stuff a shot too soon, once I get my 1GB memory stick in the mail &ndash; and if some older consoles get emulators released for the PSP, I&rsquo;ll load them up too). Super NES and GBA emulation isn&rsquo;t there yet &ndash; both ran too slow to play. NES emulation, however, is great. The emulator I&rsquo;m using is called <a href="http://psp-news.dcemu.co.uk/nesterjpsp.shtml">NesterJ</a> (as far as I know, the only one available on the PSP). I&rsquo;ve had great success with many games (Baseball Stars, Zelda, SMB2, Tecmo Bowl, Ring King, Mike Tyson&rsquo;s Punch Out, etc). Some games do not yet work correctly &ndash; sadly, NES Play Action Football is one of these, as is SMB3 and Dr. Mario. A few games refuse to load at all, but I&rsquo;m not 100% certain if they are good ROM dumps or not.</p>

<p>Game Boy / Game Boy Color emulation appears flawless. Nothing that I tried had any sort of failure or glitch whatsoever, although I did not exactly run the gamut of testing. I did spend some good time with Tetris and Final Fantasy Adventure, both running great and colorized (and FAR more pleasing to look at on a PSP screen than on their original hardware!)</p>

<p>I also played with some non-emulation PSP homebrew software &ndash; specifically, a work-in-progress version of a Bejeweled port. It isn&rsquo;t much more than a half-working game right now, but when it&rsquo;s finished, it will be a nice little game to have stored on the PSP. And it can&rsquo;t be long before someone ports a Rogue-like game like Nethack to the system, right? I&rsquo;m waiting patiently. :)</p>

<p>All of this has made the PSP, a treasure of a toy already in and of itself, even more valuable to me. It&rsquo;s one thing to emulate old games while chained to your PC. It&rsquo;s quite another to do so on a light portable handheld system with a knockout of a screen. I don&rsquo;t care to sit at my laptop and play Baseball Stars, but I&rsquo;ll do so on a plane or on a long car ride.</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;d be remiss to fail to mention that Sony is throwing up roadblocks to PSP homebrew software in the form of new firmware updates, which serve little purpose other than to close the holes that the &ldquo;exploits&rdquo; use to execute the unsigned software. But make no mistake, any firmware Sony releases is going to be cracked &ndash; it just takes time, and avoidance of the newer firmwares until then).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When they said Lumines was addicting, they weren&rsquo;t kidding.</p>

<p>I bought a PSP yesterday, along with Lumines. I enjoy the game, but can keep my use in control. I made the grave mistake, however, of letting my girlfriend play the game in the car today.</p>

<p>They say you can become addicted to crack as soon as the first time you take it. Well, I think Lumines might need to carry a similar cautionary tale. My girlfriend played Lumines in the 10 minutes it took us to get to our lunchtime destination, and the 10 minutes after lunch for the drive to drop her off back at her place.</p>

<p>As we pulled up to her place, there were no signs of her preparing to stop.</p>

<p>Try as I might, the PSP could not be separated from her hands. Any begging or pleading was met with a sharp, &ldquo;shut up&rdquo;. You see, by talking, I was <em>distracting</em> her, and that&rsquo;s just plain not allowed.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until she &ldquo;died&rdquo; that I was able to get the system back. And that was after she attempted to start a new game.</p>

<p>Tonight, I receive an IM, asking if she can come over after work tomorrow night &ldquo;and play with the PSP?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>20 minutes to addiction. Q? Entertainment, it would seem, has succeeded in making the new Tetris.</p>

<p><em>Her: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like candy&rdquo;
Me: &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
Her: &ldquo;You just want more and more&rdquo;.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like the idea of jazz crossed with electronic music. I fell in love with the Kammerflimmer Kollectief album &ldquo;Maander&rdquo; a couple of years ago. Apparently there&rsquo;s a lot of action in that space, with so many names like &ldquo;electro-jazz&rdquo; and &ldquo;future jazz&rdquo; that it&rsquo;s hard to keep up. I heard 9 Lazy 9 on SomaFM&rsquo;s Groove Salad radio stream, so I got their first album. It&rsquo;s 17 tracks of relaxed jazz over laid-back electro beats. A few tracks, like &ldquo;Brothers of the Red&rdquo;, let the jazz come out a bit more. Some cuts are a bit too placid and samey, but the high points make it clear why this album was apparently held in high regard when it came out. It does sound like some other albums I&rsquo;ve heard which came out years later. It&rsquo;s more in line with what I&rsquo;m hearing from today&rsquo;s electronic music than, say, what The Orb was doing at the same time. It&rsquo;s largely instrumental, with a few whispers or spoken lines sprinkled around. At first, it all kinda ran together&hellip; but as I&rsquo;ve listened more, it has grown on me. I&rsquo;ll need to check out their more recent albums. Nobody has to twist my arm too hard to check out another album on the Ninjatune label anyway.</p>
