  <div class="entry-content"><p>THREE exams in four classes today. And an assignment due in the 4th.  That ought to be illegal. At least this means that I have next to  nothing left to do this week.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s playlist:
Clearlight &ndash; Symphony
Rush &ndash; Signals
The Who &ndash; Quadrophenia
Rush &ndash; A Farewell to Kings
Miles Davis &ndash; Complete Bitches Brew Sessions (discs 1 and 2)
Solaris &ndash; Marsbéli Krónikák</p>

<p>I  was surprised at how much I liked some of the Rush stuff. I was also  surprised at how little I liked some of the other Rush stuff. I hadn&rsquo;t  listened to Rush in a while (save for Counterparts), but as it stands  now, the band seems to either hit-or-miss with me.</p>

<p>Every hard  rock band that wants to get a record contract should be required to  write a dissertation on why The Who&rsquo;s &ldquo;5:15&rdquo; kicks so much ass.</p>

<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t joined BMG and received <em>Complete Bitches Brew Sessions</em> yet, but I do have the set in MP3 format. What&rsquo;s interesting is how much Disc 1 of the album reminded me of Isotope 217°&rsquo;s <em>The Unstable Molecule</em>. Naturally, Isotope 217° is <em>Bitches</em> influenced (not the other way around), but since I&rsquo;m more familiar with  Isotope at this point, that&rsquo;s the connection I drew in my head.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m typing this with a Calculus book in my lap, perfecting my implicit  differentiation (well, at least learning it well enough for an exam  tomorrow).</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s rotation:
Asia Minor &ndash; Crossing The Line
Höyry-Kone &ndash; Huono Parturi
Änglagård &ndash; Epilog
Banco del Mutuo Soccorso &ndash; Darwin!
Low &ndash; Songs For A Dead Pilot EP
Kenso &ndash; Zaiya Live</p>

<p>The  Änglagård and Banco are classics. Picked up the Änglagård after Minion  (an online comrade that I may often reference here) started praising the  song &ldquo;Höstsejd&rdquo; from the album Epilog (I always sit up and take notice  when Minion praises prog outside of the &ldquo;prog mainstream&rdquo;&hellip; I think  he&rsquo;s grown more receptive to it since I&rsquo;ve eased off of my prog-pimp  ways. He still doesn&rsquo;t care for Italian&hellip; well, &ldquo;classical-influenced&rdquo;  Italian at least. I think he likes the DFA songs he&rsquo;s heard. DFA&rsquo;s just  symph-fusion that happens to be Italian).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to  listen to the Höyry-Kone some more. A lot more. It&rsquo;s very schizophrenic  and constantly changing (though I hear that the band&rsquo;s debut album is  even more varied!). Kind of hard to get a grasp on the material when it  refuses to sit still stylistically. I understand that they&rsquo;re a blast to  see live&hellip; I can imagine!</p>

<p>Now, the Asia Minor is just divine.  How I wish this album were more widely available! It&rsquo;s on Musea, so it&rsquo;s  easily mailorder-able, but I wish it could find it&rsquo;s way into record  stores the way Magna Carta and Metal Blade releases have lately (though,  believe it or not, I&rsquo;ve seen recent Cuneiform and Laser&rsquo;s Edge releases  in Tower Records! Hot damn!). It could be a lot more popular than it  is. The band is Turkish, but sing in not-too-accented English. They play  a very pleasing brand of symphonic &ndash; definitely influenced by the &lsquo;70s  British scene, but with very identifiable Middle Eastern influences,  too.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a little discussion going on at RMP  (rec.music.progressive newsgroup) about overrated bands. The discussion  started with just prog bands, but somebody mentioned listening to REM,  Cranberries, and Smashing Pumpkins in the early/mid &lsquo;90s, and that has  sparked a tangent discussion about those bands (primarily REM). Half of  the participants seem to think REM (specifically, &ldquo;Automatic for the  People&rdquo;) is fantastic, while the other half dislikes it. Most  interestingly, the divide isn&rsquo;t between &ldquo;progsnobs&rdquo; and those less  &ldquo;prog-inclined&rdquo; (ugh, that&rsquo;s a terrible term, but bear with me). Rather,  there are so-called &ldquo;progsnobs&rdquo; (also a terrible term, which hardcore  prog fans have basically taken upon themselves in a tongue-in-cheek  fashion) on both sides of the divide.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t own Automatic for  the People, but I&rsquo;ll pick up a used one sometime. I have Out of Time,  which I recently listened to after a long absence, and decided that it&rsquo;s  sorta &ldquo;ehh&rdquo;. AFTP is supposedly superior, so I&rsquo;ll give it a shot  whenever I can find a cheap copy.</p>

<p>There is a <em>ton</em> of jazz  available from the BMG music club. I&rsquo;m going to need about four  memberships to get everything I want. Need to hit up some friends to  allow me to have a membership in their name (which I&rsquo;ll pay all  associated costs for and all&hellip; hell, they can even pick a CD for  themselves for their trouble). First targets will be two John Coltrane  sets (the 4 CD &ldquo;Complete Village Vanguard Years&rdquo; set and the 3 CD  &ldquo;Impulse! Years&rdquo; set) and Miles Davis&rsquo;s &ldquo;Complete Bitches Brew Sessions&rdquo;  4 CD set. That&rsquo;s one membership right there. So much music, so little  time&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the CD changer today:
DFA &ndash; Duty Free Area
Slint &ndash; Spiderland
Labradford &ndash; Mi Media Naranja</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m  trying hard to &ldquo;get&rdquo; Slint. They&rsquo;re called the godfathers of post-rock  (much the way Marillion can be considered the godfathers of neo-prog).  And while there are definitely moments when Slint and I connect, so far  those moments have proven to be too few and far between. Spiderland  needs some more listening time before I make this opinion concrete, but  that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at right now.</p>

<p>Mi Media Naranja, on the other  hand, is a different story. I&rsquo;ve been addicted to that album since Day  One. So much, in fact, that I fear burnout might be setting in. I didn&rsquo;t  enjoy it nearly as much as I should have this afternoon. I&rsquo;m going to  shelf it for a while. I need to listen more to E Luxo So,  fixed::content, and Prazision anyway.</p>

<p>The DFA album is one of  those CDs that I&rsquo;ll put on in my car when there&rsquo;s a non-progfan in the  passenger seat (which is, basically, <em>anytime</em> that there is someone in  the passenger seat). Duty Free Area rocks. The uptempo jazz/rock blend  should appeal to damn near anyone. The Italian vocals aren&rsquo;t overbearing  (though the song that has Deus Ex Machina&rsquo;s vocalist Alberto Piras on  guest vocals might irritate some &ndash; interestingly enough, that song is  sung in no less than four different languages, alternating each line).  It&rsquo;s just a wonderful album that makes for great driving music.</p>
