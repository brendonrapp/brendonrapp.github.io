  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Digging through all those new vinyls and CDs that I bought. I just ordered 5 more CDs and an LP (thanks to a CDNow gift certificate birthday present and some good used stuff at Half.com).</p></blockquote>

<p>Soon to arrive in the mail:<br/>
Ange &ndash; Au-Dela Du Delire<br/>
Gentle Giant &ndash; Acquiring The Taste <br/>
Uz Jsme Doma &ndash; Ears<br/>
Mogwai &ndash; Ten Rapid<br/>
Ui &ndash; The Iron Apple EP<br/>
FM &ndash; Black Noise (used LP &ndash; 99 cents from Half.com)</p>

<p>Those first two CDs are among the top 100 rated albums at Gnosis (<a href="http://www.gnosis2000.net">http://www.gnosis2000.net</a>). I&rsquo;ll have the whole top 100 eventually (save the ones that are out-of-print). The Uz Jsme Doma is&hellip; I dunno. I&rsquo;ve heard good things about UJD, but I&rsquo;ve not heard them myself. But for $6.99, it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the praise. The Mogwai and Ui add to my building &ldquo;post-rock&rdquo; collection (which will be further bolstered with an order from Kranky and Constellation Records in the near future). And the FM is a prog album that I almost bought the CD of from CDNow (but the general consensus opinion is that it&rsquo;s not as good as the other things I bought). When I stumbled onto the vinyl for 99 cents at Half.com, I was quite glad I didn&rsquo;t buy the CD.</p>

<p>Playlist:<br/>
Brand X &ndash; Product<br/>
King Crimson &ndash; Lizard<br/>
Kansas &ndash; Song For America<br/>
Jethro Tull &ndash; Aqualung<br/>
PFM &ndash; Cook<br/>
Höstsonaten &ndash; Mirrorgames<br/>
Fly Pan Am &ndash; Fly Pan Am</p>

<p>Höstsonaten is such a flirt. The album keeps acting like it&rsquo;s going to be really good, and then stumbles a bit. It&rsquo;s a little frustrating because it <em>could</em> be so much better. Höstsonaten is a side-project of Finisterre&rsquo;s, so maybe I should look info Finisterre. A couple of their albums are supposed to be really good.</p>

<p><em>Fly Pan Am</em> will probably be included in my Constellation order (which I&rsquo;ll likely make later this week). I need to listen to the MP3s more, but it seems pretty good. One track goes on for entirely too long, though (I believe the third, which eclipses 17 minutes despite not having quite enough interesting material to sustain that long period of time).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s weird listening to PFM in English (on <em>Cook</em>, a live album recorded from US/Canada shows in 1974). I much prefer them in their native Italian. I&rsquo;ve avoided &ldquo;English versions&rdquo; of Italian albums, due to the overriding consensus that these albums are typically inferior to their native Italian counterparts (and due to the fact that I have no ridiculous &ldquo;must be in English!&rdquo; bias). In fact, that brings us back to the Höstsonaten album, which is sung in English (Finisterre usually sings in Italian). The vocals are OK most of the time, but there are those moments when it&rsquo;s clear that these guys aren&rsquo;t native English speakers. Those moments are annoying and detract from the overall listening experience. The fact that the Finisterre albums aren&rsquo;t in English (and thus avoids one of <em>Mirrorgames</em>&rsquo;s pitfalls) is further motivation to pick one up.</p>

<p>Brand X is interesting. When I first became a progrock fan, it was a shock to learn that Phil Collins (<em>the</em> Phil Collins) used to play in a band like Genesis (and I mean the &lsquo;70s art-rock version with Peter Gabriel on vocals, not the &#8217;80s/&#8217;90s pop band that mirrored Collins&rsquo;s solo career). It&rsquo;s even more shocking to hear Collins in Brand X, a fusion (jazz-rock) band. This is even less related to &ldquo;pop&rdquo; than Genesis (which still turned out a few singles despite not focusing on that sort of pursuit). It&rsquo;s a pretty decent album, despite being only the 5th highest rated (out of 9) at Gnosis. I hear that some of their earlier material smokes, so I&rsquo;ll keep an eye out for those. I think I might have seen a different Brand X LP at the store I bought this one from. I&rsquo;ll look closely for that next time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>THREE exams in four classes today. And an assignment due in the 4th.  That ought to be illegal. At least this means that I have next to  nothing left to do this week.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s playlist:
Clearlight &ndash; Symphony
Rush &ndash; Signals
The Who &ndash; Quadrophenia
Rush &ndash; A Farewell to Kings
Miles Davis &ndash; Complete Bitches Brew Sessions (discs 1 and 2)
Solaris &ndash; Marsbéli Krónikák</p>

<p>I  was surprised at how much I liked some of the Rush stuff. I was also  surprised at how little I liked some of the other Rush stuff. I hadn&rsquo;t  listened to Rush in a while (save for Counterparts), but as it stands  now, the band seems to either hit-or-miss with me.</p>

<p>Every hard  rock band that wants to get a record contract should be required to  write a dissertation on why The Who&rsquo;s &ldquo;5:15&rdquo; kicks so much ass.</p>

<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t joined BMG and received <em>Complete Bitches Brew Sessions</em> yet, but I do have the set in MP3 format. What&rsquo;s interesting is how much Disc 1 of the album reminded me of Isotope 217°&rsquo;s <em>The Unstable Molecule</em>. Naturally, Isotope 217° is <em>Bitches</em> influenced (not the other way around), but since I&rsquo;m more familiar with  Isotope at this point, that&rsquo;s the connection I drew in my head.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m typing this with a Calculus book in my lap, perfecting my implicit  differentiation (well, at least learning it well enough for an exam  tomorrow).</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s rotation:
Asia Minor &ndash; Crossing The Line
Höyry-Kone &ndash; Huono Parturi
Änglagård &ndash; Epilog
Banco del Mutuo Soccorso &ndash; Darwin!
Low &ndash; Songs For A Dead Pilot EP
Kenso &ndash; Zaiya Live</p>

<p>The  Änglagård and Banco are classics. Picked up the Änglagård after Minion  (an online comrade that I may often reference here) started praising the  song &ldquo;Höstsejd&rdquo; from the album Epilog (I always sit up and take notice  when Minion praises prog outside of the &ldquo;prog mainstream&rdquo;&hellip; I think  he&rsquo;s grown more receptive to it since I&rsquo;ve eased off of my prog-pimp  ways. He still doesn&rsquo;t care for Italian&hellip; well, &ldquo;classical-influenced&rdquo;  Italian at least. I think he likes the DFA songs he&rsquo;s heard. DFA&rsquo;s just  symph-fusion that happens to be Italian).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to  listen to the Höyry-Kone some more. A lot more. It&rsquo;s very schizophrenic  and constantly changing (though I hear that the band&rsquo;s debut album is  even more varied!). Kind of hard to get a grasp on the material when it  refuses to sit still stylistically. I understand that they&rsquo;re a blast to  see live&hellip; I can imagine!</p>

<p>Now, the Asia Minor is just divine.  How I wish this album were more widely available! It&rsquo;s on Musea, so it&rsquo;s  easily mailorder-able, but I wish it could find it&rsquo;s way into record  stores the way Magna Carta and Metal Blade releases have lately (though,  believe it or not, I&rsquo;ve seen recent Cuneiform and Laser&rsquo;s Edge releases  in Tower Records! Hot damn!). It could be a lot more popular than it  is. The band is Turkish, but sing in not-too-accented English. They play  a very pleasing brand of symphonic &ndash; definitely influenced by the &lsquo;70s  British scene, but with very identifiable Middle Eastern influences,  too.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a little discussion going on at RMP  (rec.music.progressive newsgroup) about overrated bands. The discussion  started with just prog bands, but somebody mentioned listening to REM,  Cranberries, and Smashing Pumpkins in the early/mid &lsquo;90s, and that has  sparked a tangent discussion about those bands (primarily REM). Half of  the participants seem to think REM (specifically, &ldquo;Automatic for the  People&rdquo;) is fantastic, while the other half dislikes it. Most  interestingly, the divide isn&rsquo;t between &ldquo;progsnobs&rdquo; and those less  &ldquo;prog-inclined&rdquo; (ugh, that&rsquo;s a terrible term, but bear with me). Rather,  there are so-called &ldquo;progsnobs&rdquo; (also a terrible term, which hardcore  prog fans have basically taken upon themselves in a tongue-in-cheek  fashion) on both sides of the divide.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t own Automatic for  the People, but I&rsquo;ll pick up a used one sometime. I have Out of Time,  which I recently listened to after a long absence, and decided that it&rsquo;s  sorta &ldquo;ehh&rdquo;. AFTP is supposedly superior, so I&rsquo;ll give it a shot  whenever I can find a cheap copy.</p>

<p>There is a <em>ton</em> of jazz  available from the BMG music club. I&rsquo;m going to need about four  memberships to get everything I want. Need to hit up some friends to  allow me to have a membership in their name (which I&rsquo;ll pay all  associated costs for and all&hellip; hell, they can even pick a CD for  themselves for their trouble). First targets will be two John Coltrane  sets (the 4 CD &ldquo;Complete Village Vanguard Years&rdquo; set and the 3 CD  &ldquo;Impulse! Years&rdquo; set) and Miles Davis&rsquo;s &ldquo;Complete Bitches Brew Sessions&rdquo;  4 CD set. That&rsquo;s one membership right there. So much music, so little  time&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the CD changer today:
DFA &ndash; Duty Free Area
Slint &ndash; Spiderland
Labradford &ndash; Mi Media Naranja</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m  trying hard to &ldquo;get&rdquo; Slint. They&rsquo;re called the godfathers of post-rock  (much the way Marillion can be considered the godfathers of neo-prog).  And while there are definitely moments when Slint and I connect, so far  those moments have proven to be too few and far between. Spiderland  needs some more listening time before I make this opinion concrete, but  that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at right now.</p>

<p>Mi Media Naranja, on the other  hand, is a different story. I&rsquo;ve been addicted to that album since Day  One. So much, in fact, that I fear burnout might be setting in. I didn&rsquo;t  enjoy it nearly as much as I should have this afternoon. I&rsquo;m going to  shelf it for a while. I need to listen more to E Luxo So,  fixed::content, and Prazision anyway.</p>

<p>The DFA album is one of  those CDs that I&rsquo;ll put on in my car when there&rsquo;s a non-progfan in the  passenger seat (which is, basically, <em>anytime</em> that there is someone in  the passenger seat). Duty Free Area rocks. The uptempo jazz/rock blend  should appeal to damn near anyone. The Italian vocals aren&rsquo;t overbearing  (though the song that has Deus Ex Machina&rsquo;s vocalist Alberto Piras on  guest vocals might irritate some &ndash; interestingly enough, that song is  sung in no less than four different languages, alternating each line).  It&rsquo;s just a wonderful album that makes for great driving music.</p>
