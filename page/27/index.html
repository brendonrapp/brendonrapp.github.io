  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Been a while since I&rsquo;ve posted. I&rsquo;ve been on Spring Break, although I haven&rsquo;t gone anywhere. Rather, I have been catching up on some much-needed rest. By the week before break, I was pretty constantly fatigued. I&rsquo;m feeling a bit better, and am ready to finish up the semester.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see, new CDs&hellip; oh yes:</p>

<p>The Who &ndash; Who&rsquo;s Next<br/>
David Tohir and his Backbone &ndash; Angels Dancing in Virga<br/>
Deus Ex Machina &ndash; Equilibrismo da Insofferenza<br/>
NeBeLNeST &ndash; NeBeLNeST<br/>
Charles Mingus &ndash; Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus<br/>
Chick Corea and Return to Forever &ndash; Light as a Feather<br/>
Ornette Coleman &ndash; The Shape of Jazz to Come</p>

<p>I have barely listened to these. You see, for the next week or so, I am instating a policy of only listening to MP3s when at home. I download so much, but a lot of it just sits there. So, for the time being, I am going to listen to MP3s when at home, and CDs when in the car and on foot.</p>

<p>Today, when sitting outside at a shopping center, I was drinking a Coke and listening to the radio that was being played for the seating area. The music mix was interesting. There was some pop, naturally, but then a Steely Dan tune played, and I didn&rsquo;t recognize which one. Furthermore, after that song, a Pink Floyd song played. That in itself was pretty interesting, but what caught my attention was the particular song. It wasn&rsquo;t one of the hits from <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em>, <em>The Wall</em>, <em>Wish You Were Here</em>, or even <em>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</em> or <em>The Division Bell</em>. I was able to identify the song as being something on <em>Meddle</em>, of all albums. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out which one (until I got home, and found out that it was &ldquo;San Tropaz&rdquo;). <em>Very</em> interesting choice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>I started thinking about what else <a href="http://www.bmgmusicservice.com">BMG music club</a> might have to offer me. After all, I have three accounts open right now. I&rsquo;ll need to choose 5 more CDs for each of the first two, and 2 more CDs for the last one (actually 10 more CDs, but I&rsquo;ve decided on 8 of them in the form of Coltrane&rsquo;s <em>Classic Quartet &ndash; Complete Impulse!</em> set). Plus I could open up two more accounts from this address. So, I figured I should check out what box sets BMG has. I was pleasantly surprised to find a bunch of ones that I would want. Check these out:</p></blockquote>

<p>Rock:<br/>
The Police &ndash; Message in a Box (4 CDs)<br/>
Eric Clapton &ndash; Crossroads (4 CDs)<br/>
Alice Cooper &ndash; Life and Crimes of Alice Cooper (4 CDs)<br/>
Led Zeppelin &ndash; Led Zeppelin remastered (4 CDs)<br/>
Lynyrd Skynyrd &ndash; Lynyrd Skynyrd (3 CDs)<br/>
The Who &ndash; 30 Years of Maximum R&amp;B (4 CDs)</p>

<p>Jazz:<br/>
Miles Davis Quintet &ndash; Complete Columbia Studio Recordings (6 CDs)</p>

<p>Classical:<br/>
Complete Works of Bach Vol. 1 (5 CDs)<br/>
Beethoven, The Five Piano Concertos (3 CDs)<br/>
The Complete Chamber Music Of Claude Debussy (3 CDs)<br/>
Brahms, Piano Trios Nos. 1-3; Piano Quartets Nos. 1-3 (3 CD)<br/>
Dvorák, Stabat Mater (2 CDs)<br/>
Godowsky, The Complete Studies On Chopin&rsquo;s Études (2 CDs)</p>

<p>I need to check on the quality of the performances of the classical sets, but the rock ones and the Miles Davis one are definite &ldquo;wants&rdquo;. For my first two accounts, I now need to buy one CD and then take four more free. So I&rsquo;ll find a couple of single CDs to get, and then pick two of the 4 CD sets (I&rsquo;ll probably start with the Alice Cooper and The Who sets). Then, I could start a 4th account with the Skynyrd and Police sets as my first 7 free, then buy one CD, and then get either the Clapton or Zeppelin box sets as the final 4 freebies.</p>

<p>The classical sets are interesting. Some of them actually sell for less than $20. So, instead of buying a single CD to meet the requirements for my other accounts, I could buy one of these sets instead for only a few dollars more. Why take up 3 freebies for the Debussey set when it only costs $16.99 (the same amount of money I would spend for a single CD to meet my membership requirements)?</p>

<p>BMG kicks ass.</p>

<p>While they have a 5 membership per household per address limitation, I could soon do 5 more accounts. Why? Well, I will be moving during the summer as I transfer to a university. New address = new memberships. Woohoo!</p>

<p>Yeah, they scalp on shipping. But look at it this way. Each CD costs about $2.50 to ship. Plus you have to pay full price for one CD (which ranges from $13-17, let&rsquo;s just say $17 for a conservative estimate). So:</p>

<p>$2.50 x 12 CDs = $30<br/>
$17 x 1 = $17<br/>
$30 + $17 = $47 approximate grand total for 12 CD shipped and the one required non-freebie paid for.</p>

<p>If I could walk into a store and pay $47 and walk out with the Who, Cooper, Skynyrd, and Debussey box sets, would I? You bet your arse! This is exactly the same thing, except that you have to wait a week or three (or five) to get them. So what? I&rsquo;m not impatient (of course, I&rsquo;m constantly getting new music, as you can see here in my near-daily entries). What a deal. Most of these box sets eclipse $30 each.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>I spent this weekend in Pismo Beach, which is located in California&rsquo;s beautiful (well, nice) central coast.</p></blockquote>

<p>I was feeling pretty crappy Friday morning, so I skipped my first class, and only went to my second.  Later that afternoon, I helped my folks load up their car, and we departed. While we have made use of on-the-beach hotels in previous Pismo trips, we stayed at a family friend&rsquo;s condo in Grover Beach this time. The nightly rate for the condo was less than half that of Pismo&rsquo;s beachside hotels. I expected the place to be fairly small, but it turned out to be a two story, 3 bedroom condo. I was thoroughly impressed.</p>

<p>This trip is probably the last one I&rsquo;ll take with my parents. Though in reality, I spent most of this trip on my own anyway. I didn&rsquo;t take my own car (a 2001 Hyundai Elantra), but that was only because my parents took their two cars (a 1996 Nissan pickup and a 2001 Hyundai Santa Fe) and gave me the keys to the Santa Fe for use while at Pismo. So there was no need to take a third car.</p>

<p>We arrived Friday night, unpacked, and went to the beach. They went and walked on the beach and the pier, while I walked around downtown (which is just off the beach). The only places that were still open were the bars and the arcade. I spent a few bucks in the arcade, and then headed for the beach myself. After a couple of hours of beach and arcade time, it was getting late, and I joined my parents and brother in returning back to the condo.</p>

<p>The bedrooms were great in this place. The one I stayed in was about the same size as my bedroom at home. The full-size bed was also nice. I don&rsquo;t have a full-size bed. Rather, I have a twin-sized bed with a water mattress. My parents have offered me a full-size bed, but I won&rsquo;t give up my mini-waterbed for anything except a proper waterbed. But anyway, when I do have to sleep abroad, I enjoy having a bed in which my feet actually have mattress underneath them. Anyway, I got in bed, threw Low&rsquo;s <em>Songs for a Dead Pilot</em> EP into my Discman, tossed on my headphones, and relaxed to the wonderful sounds of this Minnesota softcore band.</p>

<p>The next morning (well, closer to noon), I drove back out to the beach. I took my Discman with me, as well as a few CDs. I don&rsquo;t often listen to my Discman when walking around in public, but doing so this weekend has made me re-evaluate my lack of Discman usage. It was quite interesting to walk in a crowd of people listening to various different musics. Initially, I was listening to Labradford&rsquo;s <em>Mi Media Naranja</em>, which was nice and serene. After Labradford was over, I switched to Eskaton&rsquo;s <em>4 Visions</em>. Now that offered a very different experience. I don&rsquo;t quite know how to describe it, but walking down the sidewalk while listening to this French zeuhl band was a unique experience. Walking on the pier with <em>4 Visions</em> playing was even more of a trip. I think I&rsquo;m going to start carrying my Discman around more often.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided that there are a couple of things mobile Discman users need:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A Discman waist pack &ndash; While you want to avoid the &ldquo;fanny pack&rdquo; look at all costs, you can still get one of these that doesn&rsquo;t look quite so lame. A simple, slim, black waist pack is ideal.</p></li>
<li><p>A pair of headphones with volume slider &ndash; These things are divine. The ones I use not only have a single cable wire coming from the left earpiece (as opposed to one coming from each, forming an annoying little &ldquo;V&rdquo; around your neck), but it also has a volume slider further down on the cable. This way, when I want to adjust the volume of my music, I can just use this slider rather than fumble around with my waist pack. Hey, if you have to have a damn cable dangling in front of your chest, you might as well attach a practical use to it, right?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So anyway, later Saturday night, I returned to town. I spent a little more time in the arcade. I have gotten better at Ms. Pac Man than I ever expected I would. I just threw one quarter into the machine and played, and I got relatively close to the high score (of the day, at least). So I tossed another quarter in, and played some more. I beat that high score in the last second of Ms. Pac Man&rsquo;s life (I gobbled a 5000 point piece of fruit approximately 0.8 seconds before a ghost robbed Ms. Pac Man of the last of her already-too-brief lives). Still, victory! I raised the bar! After that, I headed down to the beach, with Ozric Tentacles&rsquo;s <em>Erpland</em> in the Discman.</p>

<p>Sunday was Zeuhl day. I listened to Xaal&rsquo;s <em>On The Way (En Chemin)</em> in the car on the way to the beach. This CD only cost me $6 from <a href="http://www.waysidemusic.com/limited.html">Wayside&rsquo;s limited stock</a> and has proven to be easily worth it. It&rsquo;s not the most well-mixed CD (the volume level seems to be universally too low, which did pose a problem when listening to it on my Discman &ndash; I had the volume maxed and it was still a bit too quiet), but it&rsquo;s a great album. I fully intend to get more Xaal, as this album has simply impressed the pants off of me. It&rsquo;s like the more jazz/fusiony moments of Magma, except less repetitive (note: Magma&rsquo;s use of repetition is for great dramatic effect, but it is nice that Xaal goes in a different direction rather than imitate Magma).</p>

<p>After lunch, I headed toward the pier. I yanked Xaal out of my Discman and threw in Koenjihyakkei&rsquo;s <em>Hundred Sights of Koenji</em>. Wow! The driving bass and powerful vocals made me want to kick somebody&rsquo;s ass. If I had sung the vocals out loud as I walked, I would have scared the shit out of everyone on that damn pier. Just imagine this 6&#8217;1&#8221;, 230 lb white boy, with the sides of his head shaved down fairly close to the skin, spikey hair on top (which is not altogether unintentional, but is actually just how my hair naturally acts when it&rsquo;s freshly cut short), chanting and shouting these deep unrecognizable vocals with an almost Nazi-esque fervor. They would think I&rsquo;m speaking in tongues (which, well, would be correct, as Koenjihyakkei&rsquo;s vocals appear to be in Kobaian, like Magma&rsquo;s). To fully understand what I&rsquo;m talking about, click this link to download <a href="http://www.vgpalace.com/media/Koenjihyakkei%20-%20(01">Koenjihyakkei &ndash; Ioss.mp3 (3:58, 3.82MB)</a> Ioss.mp3). You simply <em>have</em> to hear the pounding chorus of &ldquo;<strong>Ioss! Ioss! Ioss! Ioss!</strong>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As I started to leave the pier, who should appear but my best friend. Turns out he was staying in the area with some of our other friends. He was most likely checking out UC Santa Barbara, which I suspect he&rsquo;ll choose as his school. I talked with them for a little while, and then went to the arcade for some more Ms. Pac Man action (as well as some dual-gun, two-fisted-fury House of the Dead blasting). After that, I went to a thrift shop, looking for some used vinyls. There were some, but they were all crap (both in terms of the condition of the records, and the music stored on them). Ah well, it was time to head back home.</p>

<p>During the car ride home, I put Tortoise&rsquo;s <em>TNT</em> into the CD player. Ooh, it was wonderful. Especially the twangy &ldquo;I Set My Face To The Hillside&rdquo;, which came on as we past the Corcoran prison and drove through what amounted to little more than desert, a canal, and a single row of power lines.</p>

<p>When I got home, my copy of Mogwai&rsquo;s <em>Ten Rapid</em> was waiting in the mailbox. Outstanding. I threw all my gear into my room and plopped down in bed, as I was dead tired. I missed my first class this morning because I was unable to get myself up and around early enough.</p>

<p>On a different note, I have started thinking about a female friend of mine in something of a different light than before. While this friend has always been just a &ldquo;good ol&#8217;&rdquo; friend in the past, the idea of pursuing a closer relationship has been bouncing around in my head. It&rsquo;s strange&hellip; I&rsquo;ve never quite thought about her &ldquo;like that&rdquo; before. However, I have had a gut feeling that she wouldn&rsquo;t be totally repulsed by the idea of dating &ndash; I even have felt at times that she&rsquo;d say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; if I just asked her (whether this is enlightened intuition or a happy self-delusion is anyone&rsquo;s guess). Anyway, I&rsquo;m not completely sure about how I feel about the idea of dating her. I don&rsquo;t know if I could just walk up to her and ask her to dinner with these confused feelings. I do know that I need to talk to her and re-acquaint myself with her a bit (we don&rsquo;t have any classes together, so I only see her in passing). Perhaps talking to her will help clear up some of my confusion&hellip;</p>

<p>Back to music. Here&rsquo;s a list of the things I listened to this weekend:<br/>
Bozzio Levin Stevens &ndash; Black Light Syndrome<br/>
Supersister &ndash; Present From Nancy<br/>
After Crying &ndash; Megalázottak és Megszomorítottak<br/>
Labradford &ndash; Mi Media Naranja<br/>
Eskaton &ndash; 4 Visions<br/>
Low &ndash; Songs for a Dead Pilot EP<br/>
Isotope 217° &ndash; The Unstable Molecule<br/>
Xaal &ndash; On The Way (En Chemin)<br/>
Koenjihyakkei &ndash; Hundred Sights of Koenji<br/>
Magma &ndash; Mekanik Destructiw Kommandah<br/>
Ozric Tentacles &ndash; Erpland<br/>
Mogwai &ndash; EP+2<br/>
DFA &ndash; Duty Free Area<br/>

<p>Well, I haven&rsquo;t proof-read this big post, and since it was written in sections rather than straight through from beginning to end, it&rsquo;s possible that something might not make sense. If that turns out to be the case, click the &ldquo;E-mail <em>Legion</em>&rdquo; link in the left menu and berate me for my errors.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Apparently being a little depressed over a girl wasn&rsquo;t enough. Deciding that I needed to be kicked while already down, CalPoly San Luis Obispo just sent me a wonderful little rejection letter. <em>sigh</em>&hellip; as I said to someone today, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s it like for someone to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to you? I&rsquo;ve forgotten.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>On a better note, Steve from <a href="http://www.cuneiformrecords.com">Wayside</a> posted a message at rec.music.progressive stating that he would be receiving 12 copies of Kultivator&rsquo;s <em>Barndomens Stigar</em> soon. I quickly emailed him and reserved a copy. The CD that I thought might take forever to get (see Tuesday, March 8th&rsquo;s log entry) has now fallen into my lap.</p>

<p>A small victory, though. This week could have gone a lot better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Digging through all those new vinyls and CDs that I bought. I just ordered 5 more CDs and an LP (thanks to a CDNow gift certificate birthday present and some good used stuff at Half.com).</p></blockquote>

<p>Soon to arrive in the mail:<br/>
Ange &ndash; Au-Dela Du Delire<br/>
Gentle Giant &ndash; Acquiring The Taste <br/>
Uz Jsme Doma &ndash; Ears<br/>
Mogwai &ndash; Ten Rapid<br/>
Ui &ndash; The Iron Apple EP<br/>
FM &ndash; Black Noise (used LP &ndash; 99 cents from Half.com)</p>

<p>Those first two CDs are among the top 100 rated albums at Gnosis (<a href="http://www.gnosis2000.net">http://www.gnosis2000.net</a>). I&rsquo;ll have the whole top 100 eventually (save the ones that are out-of-print). The Uz Jsme Doma is&hellip; I dunno. I&rsquo;ve heard good things about UJD, but I&rsquo;ve not heard them myself. But for $6.99, it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the praise. The Mogwai and Ui add to my building &ldquo;post-rock&rdquo; collection (which will be further bolstered with an order from Kranky and Constellation Records in the near future). And the FM is a prog album that I almost bought the CD of from CDNow (but the general consensus opinion is that it&rsquo;s not as good as the other things I bought). When I stumbled onto the vinyl for 99 cents at Half.com, I was quite glad I didn&rsquo;t buy the CD.</p>

<p>Playlist:<br/>
Brand X &ndash; Product<br/>
King Crimson &ndash; Lizard<br/>

Fly Pan Am &ndash; Fly Pan Am</p>

<p>Höstsonaten is such a flirt. The album keeps acting like it&rsquo;s going to be really good, and then stumbles a bit. It&rsquo;s a little frustrating because it <em>could</em> be so much better. Höstsonaten is a side-project of Finisterre&rsquo;s, so maybe I should look info Finisterre. A couple of their albums are supposed to be really good.</p>

<p><em>Fly Pan Am</em> will probably be included in my Constellation order (which I&rsquo;ll likely make later this week). I need to listen to the MP3s more, but it seems pretty good. One track goes on for entirely too long, though (I believe the third, which eclipses 17 minutes despite not having quite enough interesting material to sustain that long period of time).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s weird listening to PFM in English (on <em>Cook</em>, a live album recorded from US/Canada shows in 1974). I much prefer them in their native Italian. I&rsquo;ve avoided &ldquo;English versions&rdquo; of Italian albums, due to the overriding consensus that these albums are typically inferior to their native Italian counterparts (and due to the fact that I have no ridiculous &ldquo;must be in English!&rdquo; bias). In fact, that brings us back to the Höstsonaten album, which is sung in English (Finisterre usually sings in Italian). The vocals are OK most of the time, but there are those moments when it&rsquo;s clear that these guys aren&rsquo;t native English speakers. Those moments are annoying and detract from the overall listening experience. The fact that the Finisterre albums aren&rsquo;t in English (and thus avoids one of <em>Mirrorgames</em>&rsquo;s pitfalls) is further motivation to pick one up.</p>

<p>Brand X is interesting. When I first became a progrock fan, it was a shock to learn that Phil Collins (<em>the</em> Phil Collins) used to play in a band like Genesis (and I mean the &lsquo;70s art-rock version with Peter Gabriel on vocals, not the &#8217;80s/&#8217;90s pop band that mirrored Collins&rsquo;s solo career). It&rsquo;s even more shocking to hear Collins in Brand X, a fusion (jazz-rock) band. This is even less related to &ldquo;pop&rdquo; than Genesis (which still turned out a few singles despite not focusing on that sort of pursuit). It&rsquo;s a pretty decent album, despite being only the 5th highest rated (out of 9) at Gnosis. I hear that some of their earlier material smokes, so I&rsquo;ll keep an eye out for those. I think I might have seen a different Brand X LP at the store I bought this one from. I&rsquo;ll look closely for that next time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>THREE exams in four classes today. And an assignment due in the 4th.  That ought to be illegal. At least this means that I have next to  nothing left to do this week.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s playlist:
Clearlight &ndash; Symphony
Rush &ndash; Signals
The Who &ndash; Quadrophenia
Rush &ndash; A Farewell to Kings
Miles Davis &ndash; Complete Bitches Brew Sessions (discs 1 and 2)
Solaris &ndash; Marsbéli Krónikák</p>

<p>I  was surprised at how much I liked some of the Rush stuff. I was also  surprised at how little I liked some of the other Rush stuff. I hadn&rsquo;t  listened to Rush in a while (save for Counterparts), but as it stands  now, the band seems to either hit-or-miss with me.</p>

<p>Every hard  rock band that wants to get a record contract should be required to  write a dissertation on why The Who&rsquo;s &ldquo;5:15&rdquo; kicks so much ass.</p>

<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t joined BMG and received <em>Complete Bitches Brew Sessions</em> yet, but I do have the set in MP3 format. What&rsquo;s interesting is how much Disc 1 of the album reminded me of Isotope 217°&rsquo;s <em>The Unstable Molecule</em>. Naturally, Isotope 217° is <em>Bitches</em> influenced (not the other way around), but since I&rsquo;m more familiar with  Isotope at this point, that&rsquo;s the connection I drew in my head.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m typing this with a Calculus book in my lap, perfecting my implicit  differentiation (well, at least learning it well enough for an exam  tomorrow).</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s rotation:
Asia Minor &ndash; Crossing The Line
Höyry-Kone &ndash; Huono Parturi
Änglagård &ndash; Epilog
Banco del Mutuo Soccorso &ndash; Darwin!
Low &ndash; Songs For A Dead Pilot EP
Kenso &ndash; Zaiya Live</p>

<p>The  Änglagård and Banco are classics. Picked up the Änglagård after Minion  (an online comrade that I may often reference here) started praising the  song &ldquo;Höstsejd&rdquo; from the album Epilog (I always sit up and take notice  when Minion praises prog outside of the &ldquo;prog mainstream&rdquo;&hellip; I think  he&rsquo;s grown more receptive to it since I&rsquo;ve eased off of my prog-pimp  ways. He still doesn&rsquo;t care for Italian&hellip; well, &ldquo;classical-influenced&rdquo;  Italian at least. I think he likes the DFA songs he&rsquo;s heard. DFA&rsquo;s just  symph-fusion that happens to be Italian).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to  listen to the Höyry-Kone some more. A lot more. It&rsquo;s very schizophrenic  and constantly changing (though I hear that the band&rsquo;s debut album is  even more varied!). Kind of hard to get a grasp on the material when it  refuses to sit still stylistically. I understand that they&rsquo;re a blast to  see live&hellip; I can imagine!</p>

<p>Now, the Asia Minor is just divine.  How I wish this album were more widely available! It&rsquo;s on Musea, so it&rsquo;s  easily mailorder-able, but I wish it could find it&rsquo;s way into record  stores the way Magna Carta and Metal Blade releases have lately (though,  believe it or not, I&rsquo;ve seen recent Cuneiform and Laser&rsquo;s Edge releases  in Tower Records! Hot damn!). It could be a lot more popular than it  is. The band is Turkish, but sing in not-too-accented English. They play  a very pleasing brand of symphonic &ndash; definitely influenced by the &lsquo;70s  British scene, but with very identifiable Middle Eastern influences,  too.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a little discussion going on at RMP  (rec.music.progressive newsgroup) about overrated bands. The discussion  started with just prog bands, but somebody mentioned listening to REM,  Cranberries, and Smashing Pumpkins in the early/mid &lsquo;90s, and that has  sparked a tangent discussion about those bands (primarily REM). Half of  the participants seem to think REM (specifically, &ldquo;Automatic for the  People&rdquo;) is fantastic, while the other half dislikes it. Most  interestingly, the divide isn&rsquo;t between &ldquo;progsnobs&rdquo; and those less  &ldquo;prog-inclined&rdquo; (ugh, that&rsquo;s a terrible term, but bear with me). Rather,  there are so-called &ldquo;progsnobs&rdquo; (also a terrible term, which hardcore  prog fans have basically taken upon themselves in a tongue-in-cheek  fashion) on both sides of the divide.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t own Automatic for  the People, but I&rsquo;ll pick up a used one sometime. I have Out of Time,  which I recently listened to after a long absence, and decided that it&rsquo;s  sorta &ldquo;ehh&rdquo;. AFTP is supposedly superior, so I&rsquo;ll give it a shot  whenever I can find a cheap copy.</p>

<p>There is a <em>ton</em> of jazz  available from the BMG music club. I&rsquo;m going to need about four  memberships to get everything I want. Need to hit up some friends to  allow me to have a membership in their name (which I&rsquo;ll pay all  associated costs for and all&hellip; hell, they can even pick a CD for  themselves for their trouble). First targets will be two John Coltrane  sets (the 4 CD &ldquo;Complete Village Vanguard Years&rdquo; set and the 3 CD  &ldquo;Impulse! Years&rdquo; set) and Miles Davis&rsquo;s &ldquo;Complete Bitches Brew Sessions&rdquo;  4 CD set. That&rsquo;s one membership right there. So much music, so little  time&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the CD changer today:
DFA &ndash; Duty Free Area
Slint &ndash; Spiderland
Labradford &ndash; Mi Media Naranja</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m  trying hard to &ldquo;get&rdquo; Slint. They&rsquo;re called the godfathers of post-rock  (much the way Marillion can be considered the godfathers of neo-prog).  And while there are definitely moments when Slint and I connect, so far  those moments have proven to be too few and far between. Spiderland  needs some more listening time before I make this opinion concrete, but  that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at right now.</p>

<p>Mi Media Naranja, on the other  hand, is a different story. I&rsquo;ve been addicted to that album since Day  One. So much, in fact, that I fear burnout might be setting in. I didn&rsquo;t  enjoy it nearly as much as I should have this afternoon. I&rsquo;m going to  shelf it for a while. I need to listen more to E Luxo So,  fixed::content, and Prazision anyway.</p>

<p>The DFA album is one of  those CDs that I&rsquo;ll put on in my car when there&rsquo;s a non-progfan in the  passenger seat (which is, basically, <em>anytime</em> that there is someone in  the passenger seat). Duty Free Area rocks. The uptempo jazz/rock blend  should appeal to damn near anyone. The Italian vocals aren&rsquo;t overbearing  (though the song that has Deus Ex Machina&rsquo;s vocalist Alberto Piras on  guest vocals might irritate some &ndash; interestingly enough, that song is  sung in no less than four different languages, alternating each line).  It&rsquo;s just a wonderful album that makes for great driving music.</p>
