  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&rsquo;t care for celebrity &ldquo;news&rdquo; much, but it&rsquo;s hard to pass on this one: <a href="http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/hiltons%20santa%20claus%20heartbreak">Paris Hilton believed in Santa Claus until she was 17.</a> She must&rsquo;ve at least figured it out by herself by then, right? Nope. Quote the trashy ho, &ldquo;a mean person told me it wasn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a mildly funny clip from Stacey&rsquo;s favorite TV show, Boy Meets World: <a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com/media/video/BMW_showedhim.avi">Corey wants to see more of Topanga (6MB video)</a>. What guy wouldn&rsquo;t want to see that side of Danielle Fishel? Funny how episodes like this don&rsquo;t seem to get shown on Disney Channel. Oh well. Here she is <a href="http://www.famous-people-search.com/danielle_fishel/danielle_fishel_pictures/danielle_fishel_001.jpg">decked out football style</a>. A Rashaan Salaam jersey never looked so good.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t read or watch anything Harry Potter. I think I&rsquo;ve seen <a href="http://bilder.filmstarts.de/verzeichnis/film/filme/h/harry.potter.4/HarryPotterIV-08.jpg">this blonde French girl</a> (the one on the left, not Gandalf!)  in previews for the next movie or something though. Well, when people looked at her past work, they found she had been <a href="http://wwtdd.com/index.php?type=one&amp;i=325">acting in the buff in some French film</a>. I wonder if that&rsquo;s what got her noticed by the Potter heads?</p>

<p>I recently discovered that <a href="http://progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=be-agw">Brian Eno&rsquo;s &ldquo;Another Green World&rdquo;</a> is a good album.</p>

<p>NPR&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/asc/">All Songs Considered</a> podcast is good too. Covers some music that I don&rsquo;t normally keep that close of an eye on. Though recent episodes have featured stuff from Adrian Belew, Kasabian, and Gentle Giant, as well as the <a href="http://www.bluenote.com/detail.asp?SelectionID=10459">lost Coltrane/Monk recording</a> that was discovered at the Library of Congress only this year.</p>

<p>Have you updated to Firefox 1.5? If not, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">get on with it already</a>.</p>

<p>So the Sharks traded for Joe Thornton. Big deal. It doesn&rsquo;t fix <a href="http://www.basketballdraft.com/hockey/2002/playoffs/news/2002/05/13/avs_sharks_ap/lg_nabokov_ap-01.jpg">their real problem</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Xbox Live&rsquo;s Major Nelson tells us: <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/2005/11/26/xbox-360-availability/">Xbox 360s are being shipped on a weekly basis</a>. A lot of retailers seem to be telling customers stupid things like, &ldquo;Microsoft won&rsquo;t send us any more until March&rdquo;. You mean retailers don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re talking about? That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re in retail.</p>

<p>Celebrating too early is bad enough, but doing it into a TV camera is worse: <a href="http://static.flickr.com/34/67957891_1c400304c2_o.gif">Here&rsquo;s Jeremy Shockey celebrating a &ldquo;game winning&rdquo; field goal</a>, only to have his jovial mood crushed when the Seattle crowd roars for the kick missing the mark and being waved &ldquo;no good&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always wondered, if people are so fragile, and things like smoking and drinking are so bad for us, what is it that makes those gnarly old guys that smoke a stogey and drink a bottle of Jack every day live until they&rsquo;re 100? So I&rsquo;m never surprised when reading articles like this: <a href="http://www.biologynews.net/archives/2005/11/26/anticancer_compound_in_beer_gaining_interest.html">Anti-cancer compound found in beer</a> (or, more accurately, the hops whose primary use is in beer).</p>

<p>One of my favorite Firefox extensions is TinyUrl Creator. TinyUrl.com is a website for turning a long URL into something like &ldquo;www.tinyurl.com/b57vz&rdquo;, which makes it nicer for pasting into emails or forum posts or whathaveyou. TinyUrl Creator lets you create a nice little TinyUrl of the site you&rsquo;re currently on with a mouse click. The extension hasn&rsquo;t been updated for Firefox 1.5 though, but someone else has <a href="http://btcorp.dyndns.org/Tools/FireFoxExtensions/">a nice little page for extensions updated for 1.5</a> by him, because the creators of the extensions have abandoned them.</p>

<p>A great Xbox 360 advertisement has been kept off of American TV because, well, people are over-sensitive and ridiculous. <a href="http://www.filerush.com/download.php?target=xboxstandoff.wmv">Watch the ad and see for yourself</a>. It&rsquo;s sad that we&rsquo;re so touchy that an ad like THIS is considered to be &ldquo;questionable content&rdquo;. The real tragedy is that it&rsquo;s a fun ad and would be one of those few advertisements that you actually enjoy seeing. Ironically, because of my TiVo use, I may have never seen the ad if it WAS on TV and not an Internet talking point.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/38/78679762_fcb6c52db7_o.jpg" alt="" /> A few weeks ago, before hopping on the plane to Austin, I went looking for some magazines to take with me for the flight. The local Tower Records is the only place I could think of with a decent selection of beneath-the-mainstream publications that didn&rsquo;t require me venturing south of Shaw Ave. Included in my purchases was <a href="http://www.groovesmag.com">Grooves</a>, a magazine focused on &ldquo;experimental electronic music&rdquo;. I discovered that I like the magazine a lot, and while it might not be quite as comprehensive as <a href="http://www.thewire.co.uk">Wire Magazine</a>, it also wouldn&rsquo;t cost a fortune to subscribe to.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, a few days ago, I saw a post on the IDM mailing list about a podcast by Grooves. I added it in iTunes, listened to it last night, and found it to be much more in line with my electronic music interests than most of the other electro-podcasts I&rsquo;ve listened to.</p>

<p>Checking out the playlist on the Grooves site, I found a few artists to pick up some albums of.</p>

<p>Also, while I was at the site, I saw the latest news post&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grooves will no longer be a print publication&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The announcement indicated that Grooves will continue on as an online magazine, with some chin-held-high comments about the print publication&rsquo;s demise and how so many things will be better this way. Though I will definitely read the website, I would prefer the print magazine. Typical, of course, that the magazine goes down <em>just as I discover it</em>. At least the podcast part isn&rsquo;t hurt by this. And hopefully it turns out to be a really good web zine. It won&rsquo;t be the first dead magazine resurrected in online form that I read &ndash; <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz">Next Generation</a> was a fantastic gaming print mag that died, only to come back (years after the fact!) in a great online version (albeit far lighter on content) .</p>

<p>So long, Grooves Magazine. We just met and you&rsquo;re already dead. Your online successor had better be every bit as good. And keep that podcast coming.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I feel sorry for hockey video game fans that only have PCs.</p>

<p>I played some NHL 06 on my laptop today, to give the game a try. I used to be a big fan of EA&rsquo;s NHL game on PCs around 2000-2001, and on the Super NES console before that. But recently, I have been playing Visual Concepts&#8217; NHL2K game on the Xbox, as it has been the superior game.</p>

<p>That sure didn&rsquo;t change this year.</p>

<p>EA&rsquo;s NHL 06 is, in a word, intolerable. The game has regressed to the point of not being worth playing anymore. The biggest problem? Physics. The skating and puck physics are more horrible than I can put into words. The puck just &ldquo;snaps&rdquo; from destination to destination, as if it&rsquo;s just warping. Even if you turn pass assist all the way down, it will still just snap from stick to stick at physically impossible speeds. The skating is just as bad. There&rsquo;s no smooth, gliding physics to it. Instead, it&rsquo;s very jittery, and players just kind of <em>skitter</em> about. There&rsquo;s no grace, or even a good sense of speed. Players kind of get &ldquo;sucked&rdquo; into collision animations. The gameplay is just flat out a waste of time. I thought at first that maybe it was just the default settings that were the problem, and all it needed was some slider tweaking. Nope! The slider options are very bare-bones and even on their extreme settings, they make very little difference.</p>

<p>But the graphics are pretty. Oh, are they pretty. Hopefully the NHL2K games start to look like that on the Xbox 360. There&rsquo;s a lot of great little touches to the game, which makes the broken state of the core game all the more tragic.</p>

<p>It amazes me just how <em>terrible</em> the EA NHL games have gotten. It&rsquo;s like nobody developing them has ever seen a hockey game, and are working solely by rough description.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t ever play it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently deleted <a href="http://www.videogamenews.com">Video Game News Radio</a> from my podcast client after coming to the conclusion that they just didn&rsquo;t have much to say for themselves. Some reading of news and lists, but as far as their own content, not much. Of the 3 &ldquo;hosts&rdquo;, one has half a clue as to what is going on in gaming, and the other two have none. Eventually, &ldquo;ha ha I&rsquo;m so out of touch&rdquo; gets old.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dreamstation.cc">DreamStation.cc&rsquo;s</a> show is still fairly good. But there seem to be a bunch of new shows out there. Hopefully there&rsquo;s someone with an entertaining show that is at least fairly knowledgeable about the subject of their show.</p>

<p>Stacey has recently taken an interest in podcasts, after discovering some Disney related ones. I think she finally &ldquo;gets&rdquo; the idea now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My experience with the Civilization games has been, to this point, limited. Derek was always a big Civ fan, but me, I only played a bit of Civ II on another friend&rsquo;s computer. It was fun, but I didn&rsquo;t REALLY get into it.</p>

<p>But with all of the <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/919352.asp?q=civilization">exceedingly positive press</a> Civilization IV has received, combined with the fact that I was wanting a nice turn-based strategy game for my laptop (and older ones like Alpha Centauri don&rsquo;t support my laptop&rsquo;s 1680x1050 widescreen display), I decided to drink the Civilization IV kool-aid.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/41/78679763_807616f700_o.jpg" alt="" /> I see what the fuss is about.</p>

<p>I became sold on the game when I coaxed the Egyptians to go to war with a French empire that had me hemmed in geographically, and was trying to strong-arm me. They warred for quite some time, but then the Russians declared war on Egypt too. Not long thereafter, Egypt declared peace with France so that they could deal with Russia&hellip; and they did it just before I was going to make my move against France. Unfortunate, but the length of the war allowed me to build and expand while the French were throwing resources into battle. Besides, the Russians were getting pissed at me too, probably looking to pillage my little colonies by their borders soon, but their war with Egypt will keep them busy.</p>

<p>And now it&rsquo;s past 4:00am and I need to sleep. I didn&rsquo;t think it was anywhere near this late.</p>

<p>Now I get it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://jaguars.com/story/Images/240x135/Story(4736" alt="" />240x135.jpg) As if the sports weekend wasn&rsquo;t good enough after Fresno State&rsquo;s victory over Boise, the Jacksonville Jaguars put a beatdown on the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday, 30-3. It&rsquo;s about time that Greg Jones started carrying the rock like the power back he was expected to be. It&rsquo;s about time Matt Jones started being a threat to opposing defenders. It&rsquo;s about time the offensive line (bolstered by rookie Khalif Barnes) kept defenders off of Byron Leftwich&rsquo;s back. And it&rsquo;s about time the Jaguars dominated a weaker opponent, instead of playing down to the competition.</p>

<p>Plus, in fantasy football, I won. And two of the three teams that I&rsquo;m fighting against for wildcard spots lost. AND, the team ahead of me in my division lost, putting me right back into the divisional race &ndash; so I might not even need a wildcard spot.</p>

<p>And the Kings keep on winning. They&rsquo;re clearly the cream of the Pacific Division right now.</p>

<p>Now, here&rsquo;s hoping NEXT weekend is just as sweet. If Fresno can knock off USC, then it wouldn&rsquo;t matter what happened the rest of the weekend&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lots of sports action in Fresno this weekend!</p>

<p>Thursday night saw what may have been the biggest game to ever take place in Bulldog Stadium. Fresno State shut down the mighty Boise State Broncos, snapping their 31-game WAC winning streak, and virtually sealing the WAC championship for the Bulldogs. Even bigger, the win will unquestionably move them up quite a bit in the national polls.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a bunch of piece of crap fraud &ldquo;fans&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t bother to even show up to the game, and others left at halftime. Many were from the &ldquo;red seats&rdquo;, but many others were from other areas, even the student section. It was embarrassing. The biggest game in forever and a bunch of so-called &ldquo;fans&rdquo; skipped it because they were afraid to get wet. Seriously shameful. Put on a damn poncho and be a fan. At the end of the game, some players and Pat Hill came to the full sections and showed their appreciation for the actual fans that did stay for the game. Still, it was a reminder that, when it comes down to it, Fresno&rsquo;s still third rate. Not the school or the football program, but the people.</p>

<p>Last night (Friday), Logan and I went to the Fresno Falcons game. They played against a former AHL team, the Utah Grizzlies. And they got steamrolled. The Grizzlies dominated physically, and the goaltender played a great game. Meanwhile, backup Falcons goalie Mike Brown was lit up like a Christmas tree, and the offense couldn&rsquo;t even get shots off on a 2-man advantage power play. They were completely outclassed. Utah played a sound, clean game, but played hard and physical.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t get much better tonight. The team looked largely ineffective against a last-place pathetic San Diego Gulls team. Power play opportunity after power play opportunity was blown, against the team with the league&rsquo;s worst penalty kill. Falcons goaltender Brett Jaegar played outstanding hockey, and that was the only thing that kept the team from getting beat. The Gulls outshot Fresno, and had many more quality scoring opportunities. The San Diego goaltender was rarely challenged. It took 9 rounds of shootout for the Falcons to finally eke out a win. Not a good sign against a cellar dweller Gulls squad.</p>

<p>Oh, and Fresno fans &ndash; just because a Falcon gets pancaked and falls to the ice doesn&rsquo;t mean there should be a penalty called. Get over it. The Falcons crowd shows about as little hockey knowledge as possible.</p>

<p>The Falcons definitely don&rsquo;t look like a team that deserves to be at the top of the division standings right now. The goaltending is there (when Jaeger is between the pipes), but the offense and forechecking is woeful. This weekend, they played at the same level as a last-place team.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, I switched all of my &ldquo;public&rdquo; email use to a Gmail account: <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#108;&#x65;&#x67;&#105;&#x6f;&#110;&#x32;&#x38;&#64;&#x67;&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;&#46;">&#x6c;&#x65;&#x67;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#50;&#56;&#x40;&#103;&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;&#46;</a></p>

<p>I had used Gmail before, but only as a throwaway email account. I had continued to use my own (economyofeffort.com) email accounts for my public mail. I used the IMAP server to allow me to access mail from different computers, using Thunderbird. Problem was, the spam filtering isn&rsquo;t as good if you&rsquo;re marking spam on differing Thunderbird installs (because each only sees a portion of your junk mail marks, so there&rsquo;s a lot of emails that are spam that would&rsquo;ve been filtered out on other computers). Plus, I have long held to the superiority of a true email client versus web-based mail.</p>

<p>But after watching a number of people at the Austin Game Conference use Gmail for their mail, I decided it was time to make my public email go through Gmail.</p>

<p>And frankly, it&rsquo;s great. It is much snappier than accessing my mail over the IMAP server, especially when dealing with large volumes of mail. And the junk mail filter works beautifully without me needing to train it (or re-train it if I&rsquo;m using a Thunderbird on a different computer, or a different OS on the same computer, etc).</p>

<p>My parents still use Hotmail for their email. I will switch them over soon.</p>
