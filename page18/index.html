  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently deleted <a href="http://www.videogamenews.com">Video Game News Radio</a> from my podcast client after coming to the conclusion that they just didn’t have much to say for themselves. Some reading of news and lists, but as far as their own content, not much. Of the 3 “hosts”, one has half a clue as to what is going on in gaming, and the other two have none. Eventually, “ha ha I’m so out of touch” gets old.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dreamstation.cc">DreamStation.cc’s</a> show is still fairly good. But there seem to be a bunch of new shows out there. Hopefully there’s someone with an entertaining show that is at least fairly knowledgeable about the subject of their show.</p>

<p>Stacey has recently taken an interest in podcasts, after discovering some Disney related ones. I think she finally “gets” the idea now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My experience with the Civilization games has been, to this point, limited. Derek was always a big Civ fan, but me, I only played a bit of Civ II on another friend’s computer. It was fun, but I didn’t REALLY get into it.</p>

<p>But with all of the <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/919352.asp?q=civilization">exceedingly positive press</a> Civilization IV has received, combined with the fact that I was wanting a nice turn-based strategy game for my laptop (and older ones like Alpha Centauri don’t support my laptop’s 1680x1050 widescreen display), I decided to drink the Civilization IV kool-aid.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/41/78679763_807616f700_o.jpg" alt="" /> I see what the fuss is about.</p>

<p>I became sold on the game when I coaxed the Egyptians to go to war with a French empire that had me hemmed in geographically, and was trying to strong-arm me. They warred for quite some time, but then the Russians declared war on Egypt too. Not long thereafter, Egypt declared peace with France so that they could deal with Russia… and they did it just before I was going to make my move against France. Unfortunate, but the length of the war allowed me to build and expand while the French were throwing resources into battle. Besides, the Russians were getting pissed at me too, probably looking to pillage my little colonies by their borders soon, but their war with Egypt will keep them busy.</p>

<p>And now it’s past 4:00am and I need to sleep. I didn’t think it was anywhere near this late.</p>

<p>Now I get it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://jaguars.com/story/Images/240x135/Story(4736)240x135.jpg" alt="" /> As if the sports weekend wasn’t good enough after Fresno State’s victory over Boise, the Jacksonville Jaguars put a beatdown on the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday, 30-3. It’s about time that Greg Jones started carrying the rock like the power back he was expected to be. It’s about time Matt Jones started being a threat to opposing defenders. It’s about time the offensive line (bolstered by rookie Khalif Barnes) kept defenders off of Byron Leftwich’s back. And it’s about time the Jaguars dominated a weaker opponent, instead of playing down to the competition.</p>

<p>Plus, in fantasy football, I won. And two of the three teams that I’m fighting against for wildcard spots lost. AND, the team ahead of me in my division lost, putting me right back into the divisional race - so I might not even need a wildcard spot.</p>

<p>And the Kings keep on winning. They’re clearly the cream of the Pacific Division right now.</p>

<p>Now, here’s hoping NEXT weekend is just as sweet. If Fresno can knock off USC, then it wouldn’t matter what happened the rest of the weekend…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lots of sports action in Fresno this weekend!</p>

<p>Thursday night saw what may have been the biggest game to ever take place in Bulldog Stadium. Fresno State shut down the mighty Boise State Broncos, snapping their 31-game WAC winning streak, and virtually sealing the WAC championship for the Bulldogs. Even bigger, the win will unquestionably move them up quite a bit in the national polls.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a bunch of piece of crap fraud “fans” didn’t bother to even show up to the game, and others left at halftime. Many were from the “red seats”, but many others were from other areas, even the student section. It was embarrassing. The biggest game in forever and a bunch of so-called “fans” skipped it because they were afraid to get wet. Seriously shameful. Put on a damn poncho and be a fan. At the end of the game, some players and Pat Hill came to the full sections and showed their appreciation for the actual fans that did stay for the game. Still, it was a reminder that, when it comes down to it, Fresno’s still third rate. Not the school or the football program, but the people.</p>

<p>Last night (Friday), Logan and I went to the Fresno Falcons game. They played against a former AHL team, the Utah Grizzlies. And they got steamrolled. The Grizzlies dominated physically, and the goaltender played a great game. Meanwhile, backup Falcons goalie Mike Brown was lit up like a Christmas tree, and the offense couldn’t even get shots off on a 2-man advantage power play. They were completely outclassed. Utah played a sound, clean game, but played hard and physical.</p>

<p>It didn’t get much better tonight. The team looked largely ineffective against a last-place pathetic San Diego Gulls team. Power play opportunity after power play opportunity was blown, against the team with the league’s worst penalty kill. Falcons goaltender Brett Jaegar played outstanding hockey, and that was the only thing that kept the team from getting beat. The Gulls outshot Fresno, and had many more quality scoring opportunities. The San Diego goaltender was rarely challenged. It took 9 rounds of shootout for the Falcons to finally eke out a win. Not a good sign against a cellar dweller Gulls squad.</p>

<p>Oh, and Fresno fans - just because a Falcon gets pancaked and falls to the ice doesn’t mean there should be a penalty called. Get over it. The Falcons crowd shows about as little hockey knowledge as possible.</p>

<p>The Falcons definitely don’t look like a team that deserves to be at the top of the division standings right now. The goaltending is there (when Jaeger is between the pipes), but the offense and forechecking is woeful. This weekend, they played at the same level as a last-place team.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, I switched all of my “public” email use to a Gmail account: legion28@gmail.com.</p>

<p>I had used Gmail before, but only as a throwaway email account. I had continued to use my own (economyofeffort.com) email accounts for my public mail. I used the IMAP server to allow me to access mail from different computers, using Thunderbird. Problem was, the spam filtering isn’t as good if you’re marking spam on differing Thunderbird installs (because each only sees a portion of your junk mail marks, so there’s a lot of emails that are spam that would’ve been filtered out on other computers). Plus, I have long held to the superiority of a true email client versus web-based mail.</p>

<p>But after watching a number of people at the Austin Game Conference use Gmail for their mail, I decided it was time to make my public email go through Gmail.</p>

<p>And frankly, it’s great. It is much snappier than accessing my mail over the IMAP server, especially when dealing with large volumes of mail. And the junk mail filter works beautifully without me needing to train it (or re-train it if I’m using a Thunderbird on a different computer, or a different OS on the same computer, etc).</p>

<p>My parents still use Hotmail for their email. I will switch them over soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been telling people about my future bathroom design plans when I own a house. I want urinals in my bathroom. A man’s bathroom should have a man’s toilet. Women complain about the toilet seat being left up - well, that’s what happens when you deny a man <em>his</em> toilet.</p>

<p>Well, now thanks to the funny inter-web, I have an idea for decoration to go with the urinals:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing my posts about the <a href="http://www.gameconference.com">Austin Game Conference</a>…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/59261252/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/31/59261252_f85010c02f_m.jpg" alt="D201 - Bartle" /></a> Friday was kicked off with a keynote by <a href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/home.htm">Dr. Richard Bartle</a>, the co-creator of the original MUD (multi-user dungeon), and a professor at the University of Essex. Bartle is an exceedingly charming Englishman whose humor appealed to the geek crowd, without going overboard. Hopefully someone was recording a video of the keynote, because I want to see it again. Bartle titled his talk, “Why Are We Here?”. He informed us that “You are all going to die”, and with that knowledge of our own mortality, why did we find it so important to be there, in Austin, right then?</p>

<p>Bartle talked about MMOs (or “virtual worlds”, as he termed such games) as a powerful means of self-expression. MMOs empower players with a very strong sense of self, as their interaction with the world revolves around their created character. Also, their actions in the world primary effect the player’s character (generally, you don’t cause rapid changes in the game world through your actions - instead, the changes happen to your character). He also drew a parallel between MMO development and the old-school hackers of the ’60s and ’70s. He claimed MMO developers largely subscribed to the same ethos as the old hackers - freedom of access, the right to be judged by your actions in the technology instead of outside of it, etc. Some of it was a bit of a stretch, but it was interesting nonetheless. It sounded a lot more plausible coming from him, I assure you.</p>

<p>The first session I attended was Microsoft’s “Introduction to XNA Studio”. Microsoft appears to be doing some great things with the development pipeline. One thing they’re trying to do is provide the same kind of content control to art assets as version control systems provide code. The XNA toolchain tracks the use of art resources, so that you’ll know exactly what is relying on a certain model or texture, and will therefore be able to tell what changing that model or texture would affect. This has not traditionally been easy, and many developers have created in-house solutions to deal with problems like this. They also announced that an XNA beta will be made available at GDC in March 2006.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/59261253/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/29/59261253_b9795b96e0_m.jpg" alt="D202 - Casual" /></a>I only attended one other session on Friday, and that was the “Casual Game Evolution Summit: Tech Today for Tomorrowâ€™s Hit”. Basically, this panel included people from Sun and Macromedia, and talked up the usefulness of Java and Flash/Shockwave for the development of “casual” games. The Sun guy insisted that Java need not be relegated only to small, lightweight games - with Java’s hooks into OpenGL, he stated that DOOM III could easily be written in Java. The discussion was focused on “casual game” development, though. Honestly, there wasn’t a lot of meat in this session. Basically, each side told us about how much more widespread their technologies are than in the past (and it’s true - Java and Flash and Shockwave penetration on home PCs is certainly up - especially Java, with the whole Microsoft VM deal behind them, and more and more Windows machines getting true Sun JRE installs). If you knew nothing about casual game development, you’d leave knowing that Java and Shockwave are good platforms for such games. Probably not news to most people at the conference.</p>

<p>The rest of my time at the conference was spent at the tech pavilion. Here’s a couple photo highlights:</p>

<p>I love this picture - Microsoft and Sony, right next to each other, living in sweet harmony:
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/59261254/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/26/59261254_50c72ad93d.jpg" alt="D203 - MS and Sony" /></a></p>

<p>The giant elephant in the room was actually a gorilla - a mascot for GameTrust’s “Go Casual” sessions:
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/59261255/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/25/59261255_d01e06fc81.jpg" alt="D204 - Go Casual" /></a></p>

<p>Microsoft had a separate “casual games” booth set up, where they displayed Xbox 360s playing some of the casual games that will be available on Xbox Live Arcade. Frankly, some of the stuff looked really neat, and I could easily see myself purchasing a few casual games to keep on my 360. I know Stacey will enjoy some of them:

<p>Hooray for PVS (potentially visible sets)!

<p>Next conference, I will be certain to have a decent camera with me. Too many of my pictures came out blurry, and even worse were the ones that I had to delete.</p>

As I am in my final year of graduate school (until I eventually go back for a Ph.D), it has become time for me to start attending the job conferences and expos for the industry that I wish to enter. This was the first such conference I have gone to, and it was quite a revealing experience. Much of what I had thought to be true was confirmed, and I also learned some new things and got some ideas for future reference.</p>

<p>I stayed at the Radisson on E. Cesar Chavez Ave., right in the heart of downtown Austin (and a direct 3 block walk down the street from the convention center where the conference was held). My 12th floor room had a view overlooking the Colorado River, and was right by the famous Congress Bridge which is the home to <a href="http://www.austin360.com/recreation/content/events/special/bats.html">the largest bat colony in North America</a>. I didn’t get a chance to see the bats, but someday soon I’ll be back. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/58435925/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/28/58435925_6140379435_m.jpg" alt="D101 - Hotel" /></a></p>

<p>The conference began with a keynote speech by Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) President John Smedley. Smedley offered his vision of online games in the future:</p>

<p>(Abridged and paraphrased): A kid walks into a Starbuck’s with his PSP. He turns it on and gets online in Untold Legends. No configuration hassle, the device just linked up to the T-Mobile hotspot and began. The kid plays with some net friends - but these friends are kids in Tokyo riding a train, playing the same game on their cell phones with GeForce2-level graphics chips (such phones are already on the market in Japan). Finally, the kid at Starbuck’s goes home, and fires up his PS3. There, he gets on the same game, with the same character, and can continue playing with his Tokyo cell phone playing friends. Obviously, the game looks different on the PS3 than on the PSP or cell phones, but the game remains consistant and universal.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/58435926/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/26/58435926_56043bedaa_m.jpg" alt="D102 - Smedley" /></a> Along the way in explaining this vision, Smedley dropped the “Leeroy Jenkins” clip on us, as well as the “chocolate milk kid” clip, as examples of how player behavior poses a challenge in the development of these games (as Smedley said, having an ogre in EverQuest with the screaming kid’s voice coming out of it would be incredibly distracting). He termed the challenge as “solving the ‘idiot’ problem”.</p>

<p>Smedley also had some interesting things to say about the upcoming console generation. When it comes to storage, Smedley said, “Guess what? Hard drives are optional on the next generation of consoles too. That doesn’t make our job any easier, but we adapt.” He offered some alternatives to hard drive storage, such as networked storage and streamable content. “We hope we can get people to buy the hard drive kits on the next gen consoles, but we’re not relying on it.”</p>

<p>He finished his keynote with some thoughts on the business model of MMO games. Subscription costs have not gone over well in the console world. Alternative solutions, however, have something to offer. He first talked about the contraversial topic of item sales for MMO games. He spoke of Station Exchange, an auction service by SOE for EverQuest 2. He said that 33% of EQ2 players are signed up for the service, and that the “secondary market” that Station Exchange is a big part of pulls down $300-$500 million a year. What was once something that was banned and shunned has instead been embraced and turned into a proft stream. (That last sentence is my editorializing - Smedley left out the part about SOE’s initial reaction to the “secondary market”).</p>

<p>Station Exchange is just an example of what Smedley called “added value services”. The idea is to make the game subscription free, but offer added value services to provide the income streams (beyond the initial game sale). He gave an example of a “velvet rope” bonus subscription for $5/month as something that could be offered.</p>

I attended a seminar named “Relational Database Chices for MMOs”. The panel featured four developers from companies that produced some major MMOs, including City of Heroes and Dark Age of Camelot. They talked about where they use relational databases, and equally important, where they do not. I was surprised to hear just how much many of their games rely on “flat files” for a number of data storage purposes. The major issue with relational databases, they told us, is the delay between the request for information, and the successful retrieval and return of that info. The databases are too slow for looking up information on-demand in real-time gameplay. Players expect their button press to be followed with action instantaneously, not button press, then a heartbeat’s time, then action. In game elements where the instant response is not so important (such as an in-game auction house), then relational databases are an option. An interesting topic of conversation was the specific relational databases each company uses - two (including the devs for Dark Age of Camelot) use MySQL, while the other two (including the devs for City of Heroes) use Microsoft SQL. The guy from Mythic relayed a story about their inquiry on pricing for an Oracle database, which used to only be determined by number of users (which, for an MMO, is outrageously large). Oracle has since begun offering pricing per CPU, which makes it feasible for new MMO design now. One final note was something that the Mythic guy said about the industry’s need for DBAs (database administrators). He said he knew plenty of companies where a DBA could walk into HR and say, “I’m a DBA. Hire me.”, and HR would answer, “OK.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/58435928/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/33/58435928_4ada6270d2_m.jpg" alt="D104 - Xbox 360" /></a> At the end of that session was a lunch break. There was another round of sessions after lunch, but I sat that one out, as none of the lectures interested me, and I wanted a chance to roam the Tech Pavilion floor without the heavy traffic that exists in-between sessions. I got a chance to talk to some recruiters from a recruiting agency (“As soon as you finish that master’s, call us”), as well as to some guys from BioWare and Microsoft. Alas, the BioWare guy pointed out that Canada isn’t an option for me at this point due to visa laws (I have the requisite degree, but not the 2 years of industry work experience needed). The Microsoft guy asked for a copy of my resume and told me to be sure to hit up the recruiters that come to Fresno State.</p>

<p>Also at the Microsoft booth was an Xbox 360 kiosk. Let me tell you: that stuff you’ve been hearing about 360 games looking like “current gen” games? Hogwash. Granted, it’s not the monsterous leap forward that the current gen systems were from the hopelessly grainy and barely-able-to-do-3D systems like the old PSX, but the difference is obvious. All of the playable demos were running at a blazing 60 frames per second in 720p. You don’t see that in screenshots, but the difference it makes when seeing it in action is obvious. It’s silky smooth enough animation to confuse with reality, rather than just smooth enough to not be “choppy”. It’s about time. Having games that don’t dip down into choppiness during high action sequences is an important hurdle to get past in order to get closer to that ever-popular buzzword, “immersion”.</p>

The ATI guy showed their <a href="http://www.ati.com/products/RadeonX1K/demos/toyshop.html">Toyshop Demo</a>, and went over some of the techniques used to create the effects in the demo. The demo uses a technique called <a href="http://ati.com/developer/SIGGRAPH05/Tatarchuk-ParallaxOcclusionMapping-Sketch-print.pdf">Parallax Occlusion Mapping</a>, which was developed by one of the ATI engineers and was a topic of a good chunk of the session. The demo also highlighted <a href="http://ati.com/developer/ShaderX2_IntroductionToHLSL.pdf">DirectX9 HLSL</a>, and some neat ideas for rendering rain in realtime cheaply. Hopefully, the presentation gets posted to their <a href="http://ati.com/developer/techpapers.html">Tech Papers &amp; Presentations</a> section of their website soon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/58435930/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/31/58435930_da53b83113_m.jpg" alt="D106 - IBM" /></a> The final session I attended on day 1 was “IBM Processors and Technologies”, in which the topic of discussion was not the Cell processor, but rather the CPU used in the Xbox 360. A bunch of details on the processor was released within the past few days, so this presentation was pretty close to the debut of a lot of information. I’m not a hardware engineer, so this wasn’t all quite up my alley, but I did get something out of the session. One of the topics of discussion was the contraversial decision of using inorder execution (as opposed to out-of-order execution, which allows for the rearrangement of commands at the instruction level, in order to minimize pipeline stalls and such.) IBM made it clear that this was a customer requirement (as in, Microsoft, and Sony for the Cell). They also said that inorder execution permits more predictable performance for the processors, and that multi-threaded processors like these benefit less from out-of-order execution - instructions that would stall everything behind it on a single core chip can be executed on a different core, while the instructions behind it can execute on a different core.</p>

<p>After the conference ended, it was time to hit the streets of Austin. Though, without any vehicle transportation, I wasn’t really going far. But I did enjoy some sights on the way back to the hotel:</p>

<p>Those id guys roll in style:

<p>Austin is truly a beautiful city:

<p>I’m not used to a city downtown that’s so… clean:

<p>I hold the line:

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am typing this from downtown Austin, TX. But we’ll get to that part later.</p>

<p>Last week, the gaming gods saw fit to bestow SOCOM III unto us. And it is good. Probably one of the last three PS2 games I will really play (the others being Shadow of the Colossus and, if Play Magazine is to be believed, Dragon Quest 8). The game has lived up to my expectations. Granted, I got a sneak peek with the online beta, but that was only one map. The rest of the game is of even higher quality than what we saw in the beta. When it comes to my online shooter time, I’m left saying, “Halo who?” (No, Kristyn, this does not mean you will be able to defeat me.)</p>

<p>Also, I had a brutal midterm and an assignment to complete for a couple of my classes. I spent the first part of the week doing nothing but studying and taking occasional SOCOM breaks. When Friday came, I was happy. All I had to do was go to work, and after that, I was free - with a hockey game to go to that evening.</p>

<p>Then, as I sat in idle traffic on Nees Ave., some idiot girl rammed into our lane of traffic, causing the person behind me to hit into me and damage the whole back end of my car. This set of a flurry of insurance activity (given the fact that there are four participants and 3 insurance companies involved and all) that continues still. My back was sore for two days, but some rest and hockey-induced adrenaline chased that away.</p>

<p>So with all that behind me, I left Fresno today (well, Wednesday) for Austin to attend the <a href="http://www.gameconference.com">Austin Game Developer’s Conference</a>. On my flight, I overheard some other attendees-to-be. Indeed, there seem to be many staying here in this Radisson Hotel, three blocks from the Convention Center where the conference is being held. My goal, of course, is to offer myself up to the recruiters, seeing as I am finishing school after next semester. Although this may end up being more of a dress rehearsal for next March’s conference in San Jose, where I will have some demo work to present (instead of just a resume), it will still prove to be a valuable learning and preparatory experience. Plus, it will give me material to pull from for my research writing class. Anything on top of all of that is a great bonus.</p>

<p>My flight from Fresno to Dallas was long, but my PSP made the time pass quickly. On Tuesday, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories released for the PSP. I ran out and got the last copy that GameStop had, in preparation for my flight. It was a good move, as the game is excellent. It’s basically GTA3 on the PSP. Some new content and tweaks that have occured in the series since then are present, of course. I was always more keen on Liberty City as a GTA setting than any of the others, so I’m pleased with the return there in this game. The only danger now is that I might go out of my way to play it in situations where I wouldn’t otherwise play my handheld games, and I’ll run out of it before the next trip I take.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’ll be posting a bunch of pictures and notes from the conference here. Thank goodness for free WiFi Internet access in the lobby.</p>
