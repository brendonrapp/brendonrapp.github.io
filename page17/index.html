  <div class="entry-content"><p>I tried <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> a few months back, and simply did not see the appeal of it. It&rsquo;s a service that allows you to save bookmarks online. OK, so what? It wasn&rsquo;t until this past week where I re-visited the site and finally &ldquo;got it&rdquo;.</p>

<p>del.icio.us lets you store bookmarks with metadata - that whole &ldquo;tags&rdquo; thing that you see popping up in a bunch of different websites. For example, I could bookmark &ldquo;CollegeFootballNews.com&rdquo; and I might assign tags like &ldquo;football&rdquo; and &ldquo;college&rdquo; to it. Then, other sites that I bookmark might get tagged with &ldquo;football&rdquo; too. So when I browse by the &ldquo;football&rdquo; tag, I see all the websites I&rsquo;ve tagged as &ldquo;football&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Now, if that was it, then it wouldn&rsquo;t be very interesting. But there are a couple of important features on top of that. First, this is a <em>social</em> bookmarking service. Which means, you can see what other people have bookmarked, how many people have bookmarked any given page, and search for bookmarks. Not only can you dig through random aggregate bookmarks, but you can see bookmarks of individual people, including &ldquo;subscribing&rdquo; to bookmark feeds of your friends or people that you find bookmark interesting things. It&rsquo;s a very neat way to discover new websites, as well as search for sites and sometimes get different/better results than you might with a Google search. Also, you can set certain bookmarks to &ldquo;private&rdquo;, so that your porn bookmarks aren&rsquo;t on display to the world. You naughty readers.</p>

<p>Secondly, every page on del.icio.us contains an RSS feed of the bookmarks on it. If you combine that with Firefox&rsquo;s &ldquo;Live Bookmarks&rdquo; feature, you can have sets of bookmarks inside your browser that you can update from any of your computers, and have those updates show up in Firefox on every other computer you use Firefox on. But even without that, it&rsquo;s nice to be able to pull up the del.icio.us website and have your bookmarks anywhere.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve discovered is that the tagging system allows me to store a much larger amount of bookmarks than I am comfortable with in a traditional, in-browser system, and gives me an easy way to find things later. Bookmarks can have many tags, and so instead of just seeing all football sites when browsing the &ldquo;football&rdquo; tag, I can narrow it down to college football by looking at the &ldquo;football&rdquo; and &ldquo;college&rdquo; tags together (&ldquo;football+college&rdquo;), and maybe even narrow it down further to sites about draft prospects (&ldquo;football+college+draft&rdquo;), etc.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of applications for this that I&rsquo;ve thought of or already began doing:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sometimes I find a website and I want to read it later. I have a tag called &ldquo;scraps&rdquo; which I use to tag just those sorts of pages. Oftentimes I would just open a new Firefox tab and leave the old tab on the site to go back to&hellip; which would work OK until I&rsquo;ve done it a few times and then notice Firefox is eating all of my RAM.</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;ve bugged Stacey for a long time to maintain a wish list, so that people can know what to buy her for gift-giving occasions. I&rsquo;ve though about writing a PHP-based &ldquo;wish list&rdquo; script but I have too many other projects that I need to spend my time on. She has been copying and pasting links into a Word document, which works OK except I have to have her email it to me anytime I want to see the latest version. Instead, I could have her bookmark those sites and tag them with &ldquo;wishlist&rdquo;, which would allow me or anyone else to see her wish list at any time.</p></li>
<li><p>Subscribing to an RSS feed of the most recent popular bookmarks - giving me a finger on the pulse of the Internet (or, at very least, a steady stream of interesting things to read - this is where a lot of my &ldquo;scraps&rdquo; bookmarks come from)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I want to get a lot of friends &amp; net-friends using del.icio.us, if only so that I can &ldquo;subscribe&rdquo; to them and check out their bookmarks. Right now, some of the site&rsquo;s functionality is down, as they are restoring things from a power failure &amp; database corruption. But the basic bookmarking &amp; tagging works, so sign up and get your bookmarks online &amp; tagged. Pretty soon, you&rsquo;ll find a lot of other new, neat stuff to bookmark.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>2005 is nearly over, and as such, it&rsquo;s time for reflection. Even though &ldquo;best of&rdquo; lists are usually best done around February the following year or so (to catch up on all those late releases or other titles you&rsquo;ve missed along the way), there is something about the finality of the end of the year that <em>compels</em> one to draw up such a list now. As such, I&rsquo;ve made a list of the 10 games that I consider to be the &ldquo;must-play&rdquo; games of 2005. (I didn&rsquo;t intentionally make it 10, it just came out that way). I also included 6 games at the end that are titles I expect might be worthy of making the list, but that I haven&rsquo;t gotten to yet.</p>

<p><strong>The Must-Play Games of 2005:</strong></p>

<p>God of War (PS2) - God of War is fast, brutal, and incredibly fun to play. It&rsquo;s fairly short, and one run-through is all you&rsquo;ll ever need to play, but it sets the new high mark for pure action games.</p>

<p>Wipeout Pure (PSP) - This is the game that made me buy a PSP. Wipeout XL for the PlayStation was one of the most fantastic racing games ever, but the Wipeout games that followed it never lived up to that pedigree. For Pure, the game went right back to its XL roots, so much so that it was originally believed to be a remake of that game. Instead, it turned out to be an all-new game that takes the old Wipeout XL gameplay and gives it some oh-so-subtle tweaks and improvements.</p>

<p>Psychonauts (Xbox) - I&rsquo;m sorry, Tim Schafer, for not believing. When I saw screenshots and read previews of Psychonauts, I didn&rsquo;t think your quirky, humorous style from the old LucasArts point-and-click adventures would thrive in a 3D platformer. I was wrong. Very wrong. You took the 3D platformer genre (one of the more boring genres of 3D games, IMO) and made it an absolute joy to play.</p>

<p>Civilization IV (PC) - For many people, Civ4 isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;strategy game of the year&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;strategy game of every year until another Civ comes along&rdquo;. And it&rsquo;s really hard to argue against that. Not many video or PC games have a shelf life even half as long as a Civilization game. People will be playing this - online and off - very frequently until another Civ game gets released. And for the first time ever, I will be in that group.</p>

<p>Lumines (PSP) - It might not ultimately endure the way Tetris does, but Lumines is one of those few puzzle games that really captured the hearts of gamers. The mixing of music and a neat twist on the &ldquo;falling blocks&rdquo; gameplay mechanics made this game a hypnotizing joy. Though many peoples' addictions were ultimately short-lived, the game still must be played - and if you can keep yourself from overdoing it early and getting burned out on it, it makes a great game to pick up and play anytime.</p>

<p>Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory (Xbox) - I like-a de Splinter Cell. Though the games are coming out with sports-like frequency, the tag-team developer approach gives each game longer than 1 year in development, and the quality has not fallen off yet. Chaos Theory is easily the best Splinter Cell game to date, despite the loss of Dennis Haysbert in the role of Lambert. The single-player campaign was the most flexible one yet, and the online play thrived with not only adversarial play, but a great new co-op mode with a whole co-op only campaign. Here&rsquo;s hoping the 4th game (coming up soon) continues to raise the bar. Metal Gear Solid is being made irrelevant in the genre.</p>

<p>Indigo Prophecy (Xbox) - Named &ldquo;Fahrenheit&rdquo; in its original European market, the game&rsquo;s name was changed to avoid any potential unwanted association or confusion with Fahrenheit 9/11 (ok then, so why not just call the game &ldquo;Celsius&rdquo;?). Indigo Prophecy is, or at least should be, a single-handed revival of the adventure genre. Gone is pointing and clicking, replaced instead with a control system much more this decade. The game strips the item-gathering, inventory-managing tedium out of the genre, and pairs it down to reasonably-logical puzzles and brief button-response action sequences, similar to Shenmue&rsquo;s &ldquo;Quick Timer Events&rdquo;. Unfortunately for us US gamers, the nudity and sex scenes from the European game are stripped out. Never thought I&rsquo;d be disappointed over such a thing, but that Detective Carla Valenti is one <a href="http://static.flickr.com/37/76666360_06970dab0b_o.jpg">finely</a> <a href="http://static.flickr.com/36/76666361_1529ef5c78_o.jpg">rendered</a> <a href="http://static.flickr.com/40/76666362_fa1fb39337_o.jpg">set of</a> <a href="http://static.flickr.com/36/76666363_3eb2638f03_o.jpg">polygons</a>.</p>

<p>NHL 2K6 (Xbox) - In some ways, this game was a disappointment. The presentation was a big step down from last year, where they had the benefit of the ESPN license. Also, some silly bugs (like in the online lobbies) just annoy and give the game that &ldquo;not quite a polished product&rdquo; feeling, AGAIN. But once again, there is one place where 2K rules, and that is the action on the ice. While EA&rsquo;s NHL game is just a terrible product in terms of actual gameplay, NHL2K6 is the best simulation of hockey in a video game yet. I would be happy with next year&rsquo;s game if they did almost nothing to the on-ice product, and just spent the time getting the off-the-ice parts of the game up to snuff.</p>

<p>Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved (Xbox 360) - Must-play games don&rsquo;t have to come on little silver discs or cost $20-50. This one costs $5 and is a direct download over Xbox Live Marketplace, and it should be purchased for every Xbox 360. It&rsquo;s a simple, hypnotic game that harkens back to the old &lsquo;80s arcade experience - but the updated presentation makes all the difference.</p>

<p>SOCOM III: US Navy SEALs (PS2) - Boy, the PS2 hardware is getting looong in the tooth. But when it comes down to it, all the prettier military combat games don&rsquo;t have the same brilliant level design or neat gameplay modes that SOCOM does. Why games like Ghost Recon haven&rsquo;t ripped off the Breach game mode, I do not know. As it is, SOCOM still has the ugliest visuals but the best map design and game modes of any online military combat game. Respawn games like Battlefield and Ghost Recon certainly are attractive to the more casual shooter, but the tension of no-respawn gameplay like SOCOM is unmatched.</p>

<p><strong>Honorary Mentions (or: Games That Might Make The List Later, Once I Play Them):</strong></p>

<p>Guitar Hero (PS2) - I am very much looking forward to playing this game. I loved Harmonix&rsquo;s earlier music-based games (Frequency and Amplitude), and this one looks to be even better.</p>

<p>Shadow of the Colossus (PS2) - It&rsquo;s sitting in the living room in Logan&rsquo;s PS2. After I finish the game I&rsquo;m currently playing, I&rsquo;m jumping right into this one. I adored Ico, and after watching Logan play this a bit, I know I will be all over this one.</p>

<p>Resident Evil 4 (GameCube) - I&rsquo;ve only played the first few minutes of this. It&rsquo;s on everyone&rsquo;s best-of lists, and it looked neat given the small part that I played. The controls weren&rsquo;t exactly intuitive, but I imagine they&rsquo;ll be just fine once I start climbing the learning curve.</p>

<p>Condemned: Criminal Origins (Xbox 360) - Survival forensic horror? Something like that. Given what I&rsquo;ve read about this game, I am looking very forward to playing it on my nice new 360.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest VIII (PS2) - I don&rsquo;t play many Japanese RPGs anymore. They used to be my favorite type of game. Androgynous anime men with big swords seemed cool when I was 14. Unfortunately, Japanese RPGs largely seem stuck in that teenage mindset. That said, I will still be giving Dragon Quest VIII a shot. Please, don&rsquo;t let the story be stupid.</p>

<p>Mario Kart DS (Nintendo DS) - I&rsquo;ll be getting a DS soon, and this is one of the major reasons why. I bashed Nintendo for not bringing Mario Kart online on the GameCube. Now they do bring Mario Kart online, and it&rsquo;s on a handheld. Well, it&rsquo;s a start.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago, I witnessed one of those interesting sequences of events that seem completely puzzling due to the fact that you came into the sequence halfway. Here&rsquo;s what happened:</p>

<p>As I walked into this Japanese food take-out place, I stood in a short line, waiting to place my order. A man walked from the seating area of the place towards the counter. As he got close, the two girls behind the counter that he walked towards waved their hands at him in a way that you do to tell a person, &ldquo;no, you misunderstand, you don&rsquo;t have to do that&rdquo;&hellip; not in a panicked or fearful sense, but just in a customer service sense. He got to the counter, and he slammed down his receipt and a single dime. He looked at them, and said in a slow, drawn-out firm tone: &ldquo;I will never come in here again.&rdquo; The girls looked stunned as he turned around and walked back to his seat. I overheard him mutter to someone something about how &ldquo;she screwed up&rdquo;, and he took his seat and began eating again.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, and I have not been able to mentally construct a sequence of events that lead up to that exchange. The dime is an interesting clue. Were they harassing him over ten cents? It sure didn&rsquo;t seem like they cared about the dime. Perhaps it&rsquo;s a red herring, and it was just some change he had in his hand and he dropped it as he slammed down the receipt. I would guess that perhaps he was given the wrong order, but he sat back down afterwards and chowed down his food.</p>

<p>Some people have very short fuses when it comes to the people that serve them food. I know Stacey has a bit of a short fuse, a lot shorter than is comfortable for me. But nothing that would end in something like this. Maybe this guy just had a REALLY short fuse about any error in his order or service.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I have no clue really. It&rsquo;s one of those things that might not be very interesting if given all the details, but in lieu of that, it&rsquo;s quite puzzling.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My parents were going to buy me an Xbox 360 for Christmas. But with the 360 supply problems, they weren&rsquo;t able to acquire one, so they threw in a catch: I could get a picture of a 360 for Christmas and get the real thing when they are finally in stores for longer than 5 seconds&hellip; or I could get the money put into my account and I go acquire it myself.</p>

<p>Normally, I&rsquo;m not in a rush for these sort of things. The last system I got at &ldquo;launch&rdquo; (I define that as within a month of release, not necessarily the DAY of launch) was the Sega Dreamcast. But you see, I have a precious few weeks of free time following these last two back-breaking semesters and before the next one. So, I wanted a damn 360 to play for these few weeks while I don&rsquo;t have the pressure of work piling up.</p>

<p>So, it was leaked online weeks ago that Best Buy was going to build up stock and resupply their stores on December 18th - this past Sunday. The internal Best Buy circular was scanned and posted online. So, I knew 360s were coming, and just a couple of days after the end of finals. I was going to be a zombie anyway, might as well be a zombie sitting outside Best Buy, right? I got my little brother Logan involved, and we got my dad&rsquo;s heavy-duty camping gear and prepared to camp out.</p>

<p>I had figured that lines wouldn&rsquo;t start to form until Best Buy closed Saturday night. Logan and I went to lunch Saturday afternoon, and then we swung by Best Buy to see what their hours for the day were. Well, when we got there, about 20 people were already standing in line. So I pushed Logan out the door, drove home, and got all of our gear while he established our spot. The camping began, for us, at 1:00pm.</p>

<p>We ended up next to a German gentleman named Hendrik. He was quiet and reserved, but nice. It wasn&rsquo;t until his wife sat in for him for a while that I learned he is a composer. The wife, by the way, was beautiful. I admit that I was slightly smitten, in a harmless way. They were in their late 30s, I&rsquo;d guess. Very pronounced German accents, which are of course attractive from women. The magazine he was reading covered people like Brian Eno, so that scored more points with me. Great people, very nice to have them next to us instead of some ADHD crackbaby kids or hardcore supernerds or anything.</p>

<p>I brought along my whiteboard, which is usually found hanging next to my desk with data structures and stuff scribbled across it. In line, though, I wrote little sign slogans to amuse myself and the people walking by. One sign read, &ldquo;If I Don&rsquo;t Get an XBOX 360, The Terrorists Have Won!&rdquo;. Another said, &ldquo;Camping for WORLD PEACE, Will Settle For An XBOX 360&rdquo;. I heard people laughing and muttering the phrases amonst themselves as they walked by throughout the day/night. Later, all of the local TV stations sent news crews to shoot footage of the line, and each of them made sure to take a separate shot of my signs. One crew even interviewed Logan on camera, though they didn&rsquo;t use the footage in the news. Too bad. It was neat to get the attention, though.</p>

<p>Everything was fun and relaxing&hellip; until the rain began. And kept going. All through the night. Then the reading of books and playing PSP games ended, and the cowering in sleeping bags began. Logan had the thick canvas weather-proof bag, while my bag was somewhat less weather-proof. So at 2:00am, Logan just sent my ass to the car and he built a little shelter out of our chairs, to cover his head (as the canvas bag took care of the rest). When the Best Buy people came outside to do a count, he called my cell and I hopped out of the car and back into my spot. Nobody cared, and I wasn&rsquo;t the only person taking shelter in cars. As long as someone was holding your position, it was cool.</p>

<p>The rain never stopped, though as the morning came, it at least lightened up. It came to a near-stop right when the store was opening to let people in. All of us close enough to the front of the line hand numbered vouchers, and were let in 5 at a time. Logan and I were #24 and #25. Best Buy only committed to carrying 20, but the managers let us know that they expected to have 40-50&hellip; they just weren&rsquo;t allowed to actually say so in definite terms. When I got to the stock room where they were handing them out, I saw the stack, and they weren&rsquo;t lying. It was about 50, keeping in mind how many were already gone from the people in front of me. The line stretched well beyond 50 people, so a lot of dudes walked away disappointed, no doubt.</p>

<p>And that was that. I&rsquo;ve already taken the system out of the box and played with it - after the misery of the rain, there was no way I was waiting until the 25th. I don&rsquo;t have any retail games for it yet, but I&rsquo;ve tried a couple of backwards compatible games (Splinter Cell is tres bien) and some Marketplace games (hooray Gauntlet and Geometry Wars). I also love the fact that demos are downloadable. Who needs those OXM demo DVDs anymore? Not anyone on Xbox Live. I&rsquo;ve played the Kameo and Madden demos - they take a while to download (each is about 1GB) but the convenience of on-demand demo downloads is a much more awesome feature than I had anticipated. I hope that most retail-released games end up having demos on Live.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. More impressions when I have some actual game discs to drop into it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have, in recent months, become very interested in the world of indie game development. Though I am expecting to soon embark on a career in professional game development, I am intrigued by those that have found a way to make some money in independent game development. The advent of the Xbox Live Marketplace on Microsoft&rsquo;s Xbox 360 console has put indie games in the living room overnight. While the ever-popular Geometry Wars might not be an indie title per se, it certainly plays like one, and fits in alongside the other true indie games on the Marketplace. Games seen in the <a href="http://igf.com/">Independent Games Festival</a> are starting to show up on Marketplace - 2005&rsquo;s grand prize winner (<a href="http://www.wikgame.com/">Wik and the Fable of Souls</a>) is now available, and hopefully a flood of other IGF finalist games start coming.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/37/74351722_c2b46aa1e3_m.jpg" alt="" /> I&rsquo;ve made it a point to begin checking out IGF finalist games before they hit Marketplace. Yesterday, I downloaded a demo of <a href="http://grubbygames.com/games.php">Professor Fizzwizzle</a>, one of the finalists for the upcoming 2006 festival. First impression: being available on Linux as well as Mac OS X and Windows is good. Second impression: the game is a neat cartoony puzzle game. The premise is simple - navigate the Professor from a starting point to a finishing point. The game can be incredibly simple, or extremely challenging. A neat feature is the different &ldquo;paths&rdquo; through the game - you can follow a path of &ldquo;advanced levels&rdquo;, or there are &ldquo;kid levels&rdquo; for children to play. The game has some neat ideas and it would seem like one of those games that would be great to play with a son or daughter (yes, parents, video games are for daughters too).</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if the game shows up on Marketplace eventually. This game costs $20 for a full version, like many indie games. $20 is probably too much. When they end up on Marketplace, they become $5 impulse purchases. I would definitely buy this on Marketplace for $5. I&rsquo;ll buy any IGF finalist game for $5, if for nothing else than to support independent game development. Hopefully indie games start to move even further beyond the &ldquo;one screen&rdquo; style of game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Albums I&rsquo;ve listened to this week:</p>

<p>Kate Bush - Aerials: A new Kate Bush album, and it&rsquo;s pretty good. It&rsquo;s a 2CD monster with the 2nd CD being a disc-long track (I&rsquo;ll refrain from calling it an &ldquo;epic&rdquo;). Not as quirky and out there as my favorite Kate Bush album (The Dreaming), but very nice and dreamlike.</p>

<p>Broadcast - Tender Buttons: I first heard this group on Groove Magazine&rsquo;s podcast, and went and got the album after reading the review in Wire. Nice electro-pop, kind of along the lines of Stereolab, but a &ldquo;dirtier&rdquo; sound, and much more willing to be sparse and not ride a steady, driving groove.</p>

<p>Tegan and Sara - So Jealouos: I shouldn&rsquo;t like this album, and there are plenty of times where I don&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re a pair of lesbian, indie-rockin' sisters, but neither syrupy-sweet nor butch or punk-noisy. It&rsquo;s punchy, catchy pop-rock, and though I can&rsquo;t stand it at times, a few tracks keep getting replayed on the ol' MP3 jukebox.</p>

<p>Radio Massacre International - Solid States: A two-disc release, the first disc of which contains parts of the group&rsquo;s performance at ProgWest in 2002, which I got to see. Anything RMI is great to listen to when going to bed.</p>

<p>Amorphous Androgynous - Tales Of Ephidrena: One of my favorite electronic groups of all time is The Future Sound of London, and Amorphous Androgynous releases are as close as we&rsquo;re going to get to any new FSOL releases. Good thing they&rsquo;re good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve finally got a Linux desktop set up how I want it, with the fewest steps possible.</p>

<p>Step 1: Download and install <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu Linux</a> (&ldquo;Breezy&rdquo; has been a big step forward IMO)
Step 2: Run the <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=66563">Automatix</a> script to install all the pesky &ldquo;non-free&rdquo; stuff (Flash, Java, Windows fonts &amp; media codecs, etc) with a few mouse clicks and no manual tinkering
Step 3: Open a terminal, type &ldquo;dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig&rdquo;, set Hinting to None, and Sub-pixel Rendering to Always</p>

<p>Step 3 was a revelation. I have long tried to get my Linux desktop fonts to look more closely like Cleartype on Windows. I was long been led to believe that hinting was the answer, and indeed, hinting was a big improvement over no hinting. But in the end, what I wanted was only sub-pixel rendering without hinting interfering with it. All that tinkering with font configuration files and stuff was unnecessary - just turning hinting off and sub-pixel rendering on in Fontconfig was all that I needed.</p>

<p>The Automatix script is something every Linux distro needs. Right now it is a 3rd party project with no shortage of developer drama surrounding it, but as it stands now, it just works. It gets all that non-free stuff installed without any of the hiccups that always seem to accompany doing it yourself.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty sweet, and this last Ubuntu install and setup routine has easily been the most painless desktop Linux setup I&rsquo;ve ever done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&rsquo;t care for celebrity &ldquo;news&rdquo; much, but it&rsquo;s hard to pass on this one: <a href="http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/hiltons%20santa%20claus%20heartbreak">Paris Hilton believed in Santa Claus until she was 17.</a> She must&rsquo;ve at least figured it out by herself by then, right? Nope. Quote the trashy ho, &ldquo;a mean person told me it wasn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a mildly funny clip from Stacey&rsquo;s favorite TV show, Boy Meets World: <a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com/media/video/BMW_showedhim.avi">Corey wants to see more of Topanga (6MB video)</a>. What guy wouldn&rsquo;t want to see that side of Danielle Fishel? Funny how episodes like this don&rsquo;t seem to get shown on Disney Channel. Oh well. Here she is <a href="http://www.famous-people-search.com/danielle_fishel/danielle_fishel_pictures/danielle_fishel_001.jpg">decked out football style</a>. A Rashaan Salaam jersey never looked so good.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t read or watch anything Harry Potter. I think I&rsquo;ve seen <a href="http://bilder.filmstarts.de/verzeichnis/film/filme/h/harry.potter.4/HarryPotterIV-08.jpg">this blonde French girl</a> (the one on the left, not Gandalf!)  in previews for the next movie or something though. Well, when people looked at her past work, they found she had been <a href="http://wwtdd.com/index.php?type=one&amp;i=325">acting in the buff in some French film</a>. I wonder if that&rsquo;s what got her noticed by the Potter heads?</p>

<p>I recently discovered that <a href="http://progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=be-agw">Brian Eno&rsquo;s &ldquo;Another Green World&rdquo;</a> is a good album.</p>

<p>NPR&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/asc/">All Songs Considered</a> podcast is good too. Covers some music that I don&rsquo;t normally keep that close of an eye on. Though recent episodes have featured stuff from Adrian Belew, Kasabian, and Gentle Giant, as well as the <a href="http://www.bluenote.com/detail.asp?SelectionID=10459">lost Coltrane/Monk recording</a> that was discovered at the Library of Congress only this year.</p>

<p>Have you updated to Firefox 1.5? If not, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">get on with it already</a>.</p>

<p>So the Sharks traded for Joe Thornton. Big deal. It doesn&rsquo;t fix <a href="http://www.basketballdraft.com/hockey/2002/playoffs/news/2002/05/13/avs_sharks_ap/lg_nabokov_ap-01.jpg">their real problem</a>.</p>
