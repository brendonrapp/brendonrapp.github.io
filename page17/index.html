  <div class="entry-content"><p>My parents were going to buy me an Xbox 360 for Christmas. But with the 360 supply problems, they weren’t able to acquire one, so they threw in a catch: I could get a picture of a 360 for Christmas and get the real thing when they are finally in stores for longer than 5 seconds… or I could get the money put into my account and I go acquire it myself.</p>

<p>Normally, I’m not in a rush for these sort of things. The last system I got at “launch” (I define that as within a month of release, not necessarily the DAY of launch) was the Sega Dreamcast. But you see, I have a precious few weeks of free time following these last two back-breaking semesters and before the next one. So, I wanted a damn 360 to play for these few weeks while I don’t have the pressure of work piling up.</p>

<p>So, it was leaked online weeks ago that Best Buy was going to build up stock and resupply their stores on December 18th - this past Sunday. The internal Best Buy circular was scanned and posted online. So, I knew 360s were coming, and just a couple of days after the end of finals. I was going to be a zombie anyway, might as well be a zombie sitting outside Best Buy, right? I got my little brother Logan involved, and we got my dad’s heavy-duty camping gear and prepared to camp out.</p>

<p>I had figured that lines wouldn’t start to form until Best Buy closed Saturday night. Logan and I went to lunch Saturday afternoon, and then we swung by Best Buy to see what their hours for the day were. Well, when we got there, about 20 people were already standing in line. So I pushed Logan out the door, drove home, and got all of our gear while he established our spot. The camping began, for us, at 1:00pm.</p>

<p>We ended up next to a German gentleman named Hendrik. He was quiet and reserved, but nice. It wasn’t until his wife sat in for him for a while that I learned he is a composer. The wife, by the way, was beautiful. I admit that I was slightly smitten, in a harmless way. They were in their late 30s, I’d guess. Very pronounced German accents, which are of course attractive from women. The magazine he was reading covered people like Brian Eno, so that scored more points with me. Great people, very nice to have them next to us instead of some ADHD crackbaby kids or hardcore supernerds or anything.</p>

<p>I brought along my whiteboard, which is usually found hanging next to my desk with data structures and stuff scribbled across it. In line, though, I wrote little sign slogans to amuse myself and the people walking by. One sign read, “If I Don’t Get an XBOX 360, The Terrorists Have Won!”. Another said, “Camping for WORLD PEACE, Will Settle For An XBOX 360”. I heard people laughing and muttering the phrases amonst themselves as they walked by throughout the day/night. Later, all of the local TV stations sent news crews to shoot footage of the line, and each of them made sure to take a separate shot of my signs. One crew even interviewed Logan on camera, though they didn’t use the footage in the news. Too bad. It was neat to get the attention, though.</p>

<p>Everything was fun and relaxing… until the rain began. And kept going. All through the night. Then the reading of books and playing PSP games ended, and the cowering in sleeping bags began. Logan had the thick canvas weather-proof bag, while my bag was somewhat less weather-proof. So at 2:00am, Logan just sent my ass to the car and he built a little shelter out of our chairs, to cover his head (as the canvas bag took care of the rest). When the Best Buy people came outside to do a count, he called my cell and I hopped out of the car and back into my spot. Nobody cared, and I wasn’t the only person taking shelter in cars. As long as someone was holding your position, it was cool.</p>

<p>The rain never stopped, though as the morning came, it at least lightened up. It came to a near-stop right when the store was opening to let people in. All of us close enough to the front of the line hand numbered vouchers, and were let in 5 at a time. Logan and I were #24 and #25. Best Buy only committed to carrying 20, but the managers let us know that they expected to have 40-50… they just weren’t allowed to actually say so in definite terms. When I got to the stock room where they were handing them out, I saw the stack, and they weren’t lying. It was about 50, keeping in mind how many were already gone from the people in front of me. The line stretched well beyond 50 people, so a lot of dudes walked away disappointed, no doubt.</p>

<p>And that was that. I’ve already taken the system out of the box and played with it - after the misery of the rain, there was no way I was waiting until the 25th. I don’t have any retail games for it yet, but I’ve tried a couple of backwards compatible games (Splinter Cell is tres bien) and some Marketplace games (hooray Gauntlet and Geometry Wars). I also love the fact that demos are downloadable. Who needs those OXM demo DVDs anymore? Not anyone on Xbox Live. I’ve played the Kameo and Madden demos - they take a while to download (each is about 1GB) but the convenience of on-demand demo downloads is a much more awesome feature than I had anticipated. I hope that most retail-released games end up having demos on Live.</p>

<p>That’s it for now. More impressions when I have some actual game discs to drop into it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have, in recent months, become very interested in the world of indie game development. Though I am expecting to soon embark on a career in professional game development, I am intrigued by those that have found a way to make some money in independent game development. The advent of the Xbox Live Marketplace on Microsoft’s Xbox 360 console has put indie games in the living room overnight. While the ever-popular Geometry Wars might not be an indie title per se, it certainly plays like one, and fits in alongside the other true indie games on the Marketplace. Games seen in the <a href="http://igf.com/">Independent Games Festival</a> are starting to show up on Marketplace - 2005’s grand prize winner (<a href="http://www.wikgame.com/">Wik and the Fable of Souls</a>) is now available, and hopefully a flood of other IGF finalist games start coming.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/37/74351722_c2b46aa1e3_m.jpg" alt="" /> I’ve made it a point to begin checking out IGF finalist games before they hit Marketplace. Yesterday, I downloaded a demo of <a href="http://grubbygames.com/games.php">Professor Fizzwizzle</a>, one of the finalists for the upcoming 2006 festival. First impression: being available on Linux as well as Mac OS X and Windows is good. Second impression: the game is a neat cartoony puzzle game. The premise is simple - navigate the Professor from a starting point to a finishing point. The game can be incredibly simple, or extremely challenging. A neat feature is the different “paths” through the game - you can follow a path of “advanced levels”, or there are “kid levels” for children to play. The game has some neat ideas and it would seem like one of those games that would be great to play with a son or daughter (yes, parents, video games are for daughters too).</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if the game shows up on Marketplace eventually. This game costs $20 for a full version, like many indie games. $20 is probably too much. When they end up on Marketplace, they become $5 impulse purchases. I would definitely buy this on Marketplace for $5. I’ll buy any IGF finalist game for $5, if for nothing else than to support independent game development. Hopefully indie games start to move even further beyond the “one screen” style of game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Albums I’ve listened to this week:</p>

<p>Kate Bush - Aerials: A new Kate Bush album, and it’s pretty good. It’s a 2CD monster with the 2nd CD being a disc-long track (I’ll refrain from calling it an “epic”). Not as quirky and out there as my favorite Kate Bush album (The Dreaming), but very nice and dreamlike.</p>

<p>Broadcast - Tender Buttons: I first heard this group on Groove Magazine’s podcast, and went and got the album after reading the review in Wire. Nice electro-pop, kind of along the lines of Stereolab, but a “dirtier” sound, and much more willing to be sparse and not ride a steady, driving groove.</p>

<p>Tegan and Sara - So Jealouos: I shouldn’t like this album, and there are plenty of times where I don’t. They’re a pair of lesbian, indie-rockin’ sisters, but neither syrupy-sweet nor butch or punk-noisy. It’s punchy, catchy pop-rock, and though I can’t stand it at times, a few tracks keep getting replayed on the ol’ MP3 jukebox.</p>

<p>Radio Massacre International - Solid States: A two-disc release, the first disc of which contains parts of the group’s performance at ProgWest in 2002, which I got to see. Anything RMI is great to listen to when going to bed.</p>

<p>Amorphous Androgynous - Tales Of Ephidrena: One of my favorite electronic groups of all time is The Future Sound of London, and Amorphous Androgynous releases are as close as we’re going to get to any new FSOL releases. Good thing they’re good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve finally got a Linux desktop set up how I want it, with the fewest steps possible.</p>

<p>Step 1: Download and install <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu Linux</a> (“Breezy” has been a big step forward IMO)
Step 2: Run the <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=66563">Automatix</a> script to install all the pesky “non-free” stuff (Flash, Java, Windows fonts &amp; media codecs, etc) with a few mouse clicks and no manual tinkering
Step 3: Open a terminal, type “dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig”, set Hinting to None, and Sub-pixel Rendering to Always</p>

<p>Step 3 was a revelation. I have long tried to get my Linux desktop fonts to look more closely like Cleartype on Windows. I was long been led to believe that hinting was the answer, and indeed, hinting was a big improvement over no hinting. But in the end, what I wanted was only sub-pixel rendering without hinting interfering with it. All that tinkering with font configuration files and stuff was unnecessary - just turning hinting off and sub-pixel rendering on in Fontconfig was all that I needed.</p>

<p>The Automatix script is something every Linux distro needs. Right now it is a 3rd party project with no shortage of developer drama surrounding it, but as it stands now, it just works. It gets all that non-free stuff installed without any of the hiccups that always seem to accompany doing it yourself.</p>

<p>It’s pretty sweet, and this last Ubuntu install and setup routine has easily been the most painless desktop Linux setup I’ve ever done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don’t care for celebrity “news” much, but it’s hard to pass on this one: <a href="http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/hiltons%20santa%20claus%20heartbreak">Paris Hilton believed in Santa Claus until she was 17.</a> She must’ve at least figured it out by herself by then, right? Nope. Quote the trashy ho, “a mean person told me it wasn’t true.”</p>

<p>Here’s a mildly funny clip from Stacey’s favorite TV show, Boy Meets World: <a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com/media/video/BMW_showedhim.avi">Corey wants to see more of Topanga (6MB video)</a>. What guy wouldn’t want to see that side of Danielle Fishel? Funny how episodes like this don’t seem to get shown on Disney Channel. Oh well. Here she is <a href="http://www.famous-people-search.com/danielle_fishel/danielle_fishel_pictures/danielle_fishel_001.jpg">decked out football style</a>. A Rashaan Salaam jersey never looked so good.</p>

<p>I don’t read or watch anything Harry Potter. I think I’ve seen <a href="http://bilder.filmstarts.de/verzeichnis/film/filme/h/harry.potter.4/HarryPotterIV-08.jpg">this blonde French girl</a> (the one on the left, not Gandalf!)  in previews for the next movie or something though. Well, when people looked at her past work, they found she had been <a href="http://wwtdd.com/index.php?type=one&amp;i=325">acting in the buff in some French film</a>. I wonder if that’s what got her noticed by the Potter heads?</p>

<p>I recently discovered that <a href="http://progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=be-agw">Brian Eno’s “Another Green World”</a> is a good album.</p>

<p>NPR’s <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/asc/">All Songs Considered</a> podcast is good too. Covers some music that I don’t normally keep that close of an eye on. Though recent episodes have featured stuff from Adrian Belew, Kasabian, and Gentle Giant, as well as the <a href="http://www.bluenote.com/detail.asp?SelectionID=10459">lost Coltrane/Monk recording</a> that was discovered at the Library of Congress only this year.</p>

<p>Have you updated to Firefox 1.5? If not, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">get on with it already</a>.</p>

<p>So the Sharks traded for Joe Thornton. Big deal. It doesn’t fix <a href="http://www.basketballdraft.com/hockey/2002/playoffs/news/2002/05/13/avs_sharks_ap/lg_nabokov_ap-01.jpg">their real problem</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Xbox Live’s Major Nelson tells us: <a href="http://www.majornelson.com/2005/11/26/xbox-360-availability/">Xbox 360s are being shipped on a weekly basis</a>. A lot of retailers seem to be telling customers stupid things like, “Microsoft won’t send us any more until March”. You mean retailers don’t know what they’re talking about? That’s why they’re in retail.</p>

<p>Celebrating too early is bad enough, but doing it into a TV camera is worse: <a href="http://static.flickr.com/34/67957891_1c400304c2_o.gif">Here’s Jeremy Shockey celebrating a “game winning” field goal</a>, only to have his jovial mood crushed when the Seattle crowd roars for the kick missing the mark and being waved “no good”.</p>

<p>I’ve always wondered, if people are so fragile, and things like smoking and drinking are so bad for us, what is it that makes those gnarly old guys that smoke a stogey and drink a bottle of Jack every day live until they’re 100? So I’m never surprised when reading articles like this: <a href="http://www.biologynews.net/archives/2005/11/26/anticancer_compound_in_beer_gaining_interest.html">Anti-cancer compound found in beer</a> (or, more accurately, the hops whose primary use is in beer).</p>

<p>One of my favorite Firefox extensions is TinyUrl Creator. TinyUrl.com is a website for turning a long URL into something like “www.tinyurl.com/b57vz”, which makes it nicer for pasting into emails or forum posts or whathaveyou. TinyUrl Creator lets you create a nice little TinyUrl of the site you’re currently on with a mouse click. The extension hasn’t been updated for Firefox 1.5 though, but someone else has <a href="http://btcorp.dyndns.org/Tools/FireFoxExtensions/">a nice little page for extensions updated for 1.5</a> by him, because the creators of the extensions have abandoned them.</p>

<p>A great Xbox 360 advertisement has been kept off of American TV because, well, people are over-sensitive and ridiculous. <a href="http://www.filerush.com/download.php?target=xboxstandoff.wmv">Watch the ad and see for yourself</a>. It’s sad that we’re so touchy that an ad like THIS is considered to be “questionable content”. The real tragedy is that it’s a fun ad and would be one of those few advertisements that you actually enjoy seeing. Ironically, because of my TiVo use, I may have never seen the ad if it WAS on TV and not an Internet talking point.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/38/78679762_fcb6c52db7_o.jpg" alt="" /> A few weeks ago, before hopping on the plane to Austin, I went looking for some magazines to take with me for the flight. The local Tower Records is the only place I could think of with a decent selection of beneath-the-mainstream publications that didn’t require me venturing south of Shaw Ave. Included in my purchases was <a href="http://www.groovesmag.com">Grooves</a>, a magazine focused on “experimental electronic music”. I discovered that I like the magazine a lot, and while it might not be quite as comprehensive as <a href="http://www.thewire.co.uk">Wire Magazine</a>, it also wouldn’t cost a fortune to subscribe to.</p>

<p>What’s more, a few days ago, I saw a post on the IDM mailing list about a podcast by Grooves. I added it in iTunes, listened to it last night, and found it to be much more in line with my electronic music interests than most of the other electro-podcasts I’ve listened to.</p>

<p>Checking out the playlist on the Grooves site, I found a few artists to pick up some albums of.</p>

<p>Also, while I was at the site, I saw the latest news post…</p>

<p>“Grooves will no longer be a print publication”.</p>

<p>The announcement indicated that Grooves will continue on as an online magazine, with some chin-held-high comments about the print publication’s demise and how so many things will be better this way. Though I will definitely read the website, I would prefer the print magazine. Typical, of course, that the magazine goes down <em>just as I discover it</em>. At least the podcast part isn’t hurt by this. And hopefully it turns out to be a really good web zine. It won’t be the first dead magazine resurrected in online form that I read - <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz">Next Generation</a> was a fantastic gaming print mag that died, only to come back (years after the fact!) in a great online version (albeit far lighter on content) .</p>

<p>So long, Grooves Magazine. We just met and you’re already dead. Your online successor had better be every bit as good. And keep that podcast coming.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I feel sorry for hockey video game fans that only have PCs.</p>

<p>I played some NHL 06 on my laptop today, to give the game a try. I used to be a big fan of EA’s NHL game on PCs around 2000-2001, and on the Super NES console before that. But recently, I have been playing Visual Concepts’ NHL2K game on the Xbox, as it has been the superior game.</p>

<p>That sure didn’t change this year.</p>

<p>EA’s NHL 06 is, in a word, intolerable. The game has regressed to the point of not being worth playing anymore. The biggest problem? Physics. The skating and puck physics are more horrible than I can put into words. The puck just “snaps” from destination to destination, as if it’s just warping. Even if you turn pass assist all the way down, it will still just snap from stick to stick at physically impossible speeds. The skating is just as bad. There’s no smooth, gliding physics to it. Instead, it’s very jittery, and players just kind of <em>skitter</em> about. There’s no grace, or even a good sense of speed. Players kind of get “sucked” into collision animations. The gameplay is just flat out a waste of time. I thought at first that maybe it was just the default settings that were the problem, and all it needed was some slider tweaking. Nope! The slider options are very bare-bones and even on their extreme settings, they make very little difference.</p>

<p>But the graphics are pretty. Oh, are they pretty. Hopefully the NHL2K games start to look like that on the Xbox 360. There’s a lot of great little touches to the game, which makes the broken state of the core game all the more tragic.</p>

<p>It amazes me just how <em>terrible</em> the EA NHL games have gotten. It’s like nobody developing them has ever seen a hockey game, and are working solely by rough description.</p>

<p>Don’t ever play it.</p>
