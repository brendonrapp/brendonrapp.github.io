    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve posted before about Stacey and games. Now that we&rsquo;re married, Stacey&rsquo;s gaming habit is being helped into high gear.</p>

<p>Stacey already loves playing puzzle games (Zuma!), and novel games like Guitar Hero or Katamari Damacy. However, she has long watched me play shooter games with my friends, and it&rsquo;s her turn to get in on that action.</p>

<p>So, the first thing she needs is to master the dual-thumbstick aiming of console shooters. Once you have that skill, you can jump from game to game (and with games like Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2 coming out, we will have games to jump to). Thus begins Stacey&rsquo;s Basic Weapons Training.</p>

<p>Her first game in this training is Halo 2, an easy choice because it has an &ldquo;Easy&rdquo; difficulty setting, so that she can learn without getting wasted instantly a la Rainbow Six. Improvement has been steady, and it won&rsquo;t be long before she finds a comfort zone. It won&rsquo;t be long before she&rsquo;s playing online.</p>
