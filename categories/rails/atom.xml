    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>tl;dr: Hyphens bad.</strong></p>

<p>I encountered a strange bug in Rails 3.2.13 this week. I kept getting an error that traced back to the very start of a partial:</p>

<p><code>
_example-partial-logged-in.html.haml:1: syntax error, unexpected keyword_in, expecting keyword_end
</code></p>

<p>I tracked it down to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/7079">this issue</a>, which pointed out that the error was related to the hyphenated name ending with a Ruby reserved word.</p>

<p>By convention, Rails uses underscores for word separation in file names. Hyphens are not completely disallowed (the above works if I rename the file to end with a non-reserve word), but can lead to issues.</p>

<p>The issue linked above contains a pull request for a better error message, which was merged into Rails 4. But for those still on Rails 3 and earlier, if you see this vague error message, now you know why.</p>
