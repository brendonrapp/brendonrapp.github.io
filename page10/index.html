<p>Salinas has such poor literacy that, despite being the largest city in Monterey County, every major bookstore has said “umm, no thanks” to the idea of coming to town. Can you tell?</p>

<p>The worst part is, for such a sign to have been made, both the customer <em>and</em> the signmaker failed to recognize the problem.</p>

<p>This is the same city that had a sign pointing to the John Steinbeck center that was missing the first “e” in Steinbeck (pretty bad, since EVERYTHING in Salinas is named after Steinbeck). I wish I had taken a picture of that.</p>

<p>I thought Fresno was dumb!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are a great many games that I have intended to play (and finish), but have not yet done so. Some are games that I started but didn’t follow through, and others are games I simply never got to. I’ve done a great job lately in finishing games that I start, and I’m now going back and playing games I’ve missed (as evidenced by the Gearbox Half-Life expansions and now the Brothers in Arms titles).

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The title says it all: I love Japanese product packaging.</p>

<p>The latest example? The Scythe “Mini Kaze”:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/mini-kaze_package.jpg"><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/mini-kaze_package.jpg" alt="Mini Kaze" /></a></p>

<p>It’s a 40mm computer case fan (which, if you’re not aware, is a tiny little thing, about the size of a CPU). It costs $4. Most case fans you buy, especially small, inconsequential, non-glowy fans, come bare or with the most minimal of packaging. But not Scythe’s product. Not only does it get a fancy brand name, it’s got bright colorful packaging that proudly proclaims the fan’s specs, as well as it’s “2Way Connection!”.</p>

<p>Can’t say I’ve ever seen so much branding and packaging effort for the smallest of computer case fans.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I wait for the Half-Life: Decay mod to finally release (currently in the hands of beta testers), I took notice of the two Gearbox shooters scheduled for 2008 (Brothers in Arms: Hell’s Highway, and Borderlands), and thought about the fact that I have not played either of Gearbox’s full-length PC games (the first two Brothers in Arms titles). So I decided that I should play through the two of those, and hopefully by the time I’m done with them, I will be able to continue my Half-Life journey.</p>

<p>I’ll be quite the Gearbox guru when all is said and done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, the founder of a <a href="http://www.gamerswithjobs.com">certain gaming website</a> shot some barbs at me about writing something that’s updated only once a month (very unfairly ignoring my four post October). With my favorite football team unable to provide me any prized smack-back fodder, I can only hang my head and mumble, and begin to post more. I hate not having the upper hand. :(</p>

<p>I posted a 2007 Top 10 games list in a thread on said gaming website, which looked like this:
<a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ecstatictf2.jpg"><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ecstatictf2.jpg" alt="Team Fortress 2" /></a></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Team Fortress 2 (PC)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>BioShock (PC)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Portal (PC)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>World in Conflict (PC)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Half-Life 2: Episode Two (PC)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Call of Duty IV: Modern Warfare (360)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forza Motorsport 2 (360)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supreme Commander (PC)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mass Effect (360)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune (PS3)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>However, in my haste to respond to the thread, I think I may have filled out the bottom of my list poorly. After having played more of Sam &amp; Max: Season 1 on GameTap, I think I would have to move that in around the #8 spot in place of Supreme Commander. I could also easily see Tomb Raider: Anniversary, Sid Meier’s Pirates (PSP), or even Peggle challenging for the spots on the bottom of the list.</p>

<p>A list doesn’t give a sense of scale to the different slots. If it did, my list would have Team Fortress 2 at #1, and the next game wouldn’t come in until about #18 or so. Then, the next four games (BioShock, Portal, World in Conflict, and Half-Life 2: Episode 2) would have a wide gap between them and the rest of the crowd.</p>

<p>A lot has been said about whether 2008 can be even half of what 2007 was, in terms of new games. I don’t know about that, but I do know two of my most-anticipated 2007 games ended up getting pushed into 2008. Here’s what I’m looking forward to this year:</p>

<p>The A-List</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Left 4 Dead - My prediction for Game of the Year 2008. Finally, a co-op game built with staying power. Valve being involved in development even before buying Turtle Rock Studios only helps matters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SOCOM: Confrontation - A return to classic SOCOM, the only franchise still doing non-respawn team-based tactical shooters (unless you count playing Counter-Strike, like I used to <em>eight years ago</em>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>LittleBigPlanet - The most exciting part of this game is the fact that the game that ships could suck rocks and it wouldn’t matter, the community will take those powerful tools and make a better game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spore - My fondest Sim-related memories are actually playing Sim Earth and Sim Life. And while I doubt we’ll be able to create a world destroyer like the Ratigator was, I still look forward to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fallout 3 - I call the first two Fallouts The Greatest Games Ever Not Named System Shock 2. Yet, I’ve got reasonable expectations for this title. If it’s post-nuclear Oblivion, that’s still a good enough game for me to enjoy. Anything more will be a great bonus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alan Wake - I loved the Max Payne games, and I love the concept behind this game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Battlefield: Bad Company - I think there’s a tendency to automatically write off a console Battlefield game, given that the Modern Combat games were quick and rough attempts at migrating the Battlefield gameplay to the new platform. Bad Company looks like the first BF console game that’s fully realized. The videos are amazing looking. I’m extremely interested.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brutal Legend - Any Tim Schafer game is A-List material for me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Grand Theft Auto IV - I don’t get why so many people are down on this, as it has me anticipating a GTA game for the first time since Vice City (I didn’t even bother with San Andreas, and only played the PSP games a little).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dragon Age - Hopefully the long-standing silence will be broken soon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>echochrome - A very neat looking puzzle game for my PSP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More Team Fortress 2 content - More maps, more game modes, and a new set of unlockable weapons. I’m there.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The B-List</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 - It’ll be typical Ubi shooter fare, no doubt. But at least this franchise is the one with functioning networking code. Despite numerous flaws, R6:V was an awesome co-op game, and I’m sure R6:V2 will be great co-op fun for us again, especially with a spring release date.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Splinter Cell: Conviction - There’s been so much doubt and naysaying over the new direction of Splinter Cell, but the team handling this one includes the lion’s share of the Chaos Theory core team. I like that the project has been delayed to allow sufficient time to go into it, and I like that they look to be taking the Assassin’s Creed crowd mechanics and doing something that’s hopefully better with it. I will miss the classic shadow crawling gameplay, though… especially with no other title that I can think of stepping in to fill the void.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>WipeOut HD - This is almost A-List material for me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>WipeOut Pulse - WipeOut’s return to form has been wonderful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena - Would be an A-List game if it were brand new instead of a remake (of which I completed the original version). Still, I’m awfully excited to see this great game in “next-gen” glory, and with additional content.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tomb Raider: Underworld - Crystal Dynamics must be Jesus, because they sure have Lara doing a great Lazarus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Civilization: Revolution - The reason my wife won’t see her DS for months.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Condemned 2: Bloodshot - The first Condemned was an excellent game, especially for a 3rd party console launch title.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>LEGO Indiana Jones (and LEGO Batman) - It’s like LEGO Star Wars except with licenses that I’m less burned out on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brothers in Arms: Hell’s Highway, Far Cry 2, Project Origin: None “wow” me, but I like shooting stuff.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>StarCraft II - I won’t jump into the fanatical multiplayer fray much, but it should hold my interest in solo play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Space Siege - I like Chris Taylor games.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Maybe List</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fable 2 - I am actually starting a play-through of the first Fable game, which I just didn’t get around to before.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Too Human - Even with all of the baggage, I’ve got a feeling there’s a good game in there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>HALF-LIFE REPLAY: 37.5% COMPLETE (3/8)</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/half_life-_blue_shift-6.jpg"><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/half_life-_blue_shift-6.jpg" alt="Half-Life: Blue Shift" /></a>Even though I hadn’t played either expansion, I “knew” Opposing Force was better than Blue Shift. Why? Because every review said so. “Too short”, they said of Blue Shift. “Two years too late”, they said. Indeed, Blue Shift came out in 2001, two years after Opposing Force and three after Half-Life itself. 3 years is a long time between a game and its expansion pack. Of course, Blue Shift was originally destined to be an exclusive for the Sega Dreamcast version of Half-Life, but Sega terminated the Dreamcast console just weeks before Half-Life was to be released. Gearbox repurposed Blue Shift into a PC expansion, and out it came to an audience that had already moved on.</p>

<p>We see this in the GameRankings scores. 86.1% for Opposing Force. A puny 69.0% for Blue Shift.</p>

<p>But there’s just one thing. Blue Shift is better.</p>

<p><strong>The Good:</strong> Oh, it’s short all right. But it also doesn’t waste any time. It’s a tight 3-5 hour campaign. It may have followed in Star Trek: Elite Force’s footsteps, but the brevity doesn’t detract from the experience at all. Unlike Opposing Force, which felt the burning need to change and one-up everything about Half-Life, Blue Shift was perfectly content to just be <em>more Half-Life</em>. Security guard Barney Calhoun wielded the same crowbar/pistol/Colt/shotgun/M4 arsenal Gordon Freeman did. The game brought back the Black Mesa “real place” vibe of the original game, with some back-and-forth between rooms instead of a straight shot through a series of disconnected areas. But like Opposing Force, Blue Shift kept the jumping puzzles few and relatively easy. Instead, Blue Shift really focused on the combat with the Marines, and was much stronger for it. And to top it all off, Blue Shift carries the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_High_Definition_Pack">Half-Life High Definition Pack</a>, which upgraded the character models (in both Blue Shift as well as the older HL games) considerably. If you’re playing these older HL games on Steam, <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=news&amp;id=438">follow this link</a> to install the HL:HD Pack (you don’t need Blue Steam to do so, and it upgrades all of the original Half-Life games).</p>

<p><strong>The Bad:</strong> Blue Shift doesn’t hit the same highs as Half-Life, or a couple of the neater sections of Opposing Force, though I think it was far more consistent than OpFor. While the jumping puzzles were few, they were still present, including another “floating platforms on Xen” puzzle, which doesn’t even bother to thinly veil the fact that it’s a pure jumping puzzle (at least the Xen jumping puzzle was considerably easier than its Half-Life counterpart). I can also understand players being annoyed at the fact that Blue Shift brings almost nothing brand new of its own to the table.</p>

<p>When you get right down to it, Blue Shift is purely an added chapter to the original Half-Life, nothing more. Whether that’s a bad thing or not comes down to personal preference. Opposing Force attempts to be more, but in doing so, I felt it came up a bit short. Blue Shift stuck to the Half-Life formula like a blueprint, and while there were few surprises, it was a good ride. I think it says a lot for all of these games that I’ve played through them sequentially in a short time frame, and still don’t find myself bored with the game’s formula.</p>

<p>Next up is Gearbox’s little-known <em>third</em> Half-Life expansion, Decay. While Decay was only officially released as an added chapter to the PlayStation 2 port of Half-Life, a mod team has been hard at work <a href="http://decay.half-lifecreations.com">porting it to the PC</a> (I previously stated on this blog that the mod was a Source-engine mod; this is not true. It is an original Half-Life mod, with a Source port potentially coming in the future). The mod’s unofficial release dates have been pushed back a few times, though the developers indicate that it’s close to release. That puts the brakes on my journey through the Half-Life saga for now. Hopefully we’ll see a December release for the game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>HALF-LIFE REPLAY: 25% COMPLETE (2/8)</em></p>

<p>This was my first time playing Opposing Force (or, indeed, any of the Gearbox developed Half-Life content), and the experience was generally positive, if not quite as strongly as the Half-Life replay was.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/opfor_switch2.png"><img src="http://www.economyofeffort.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/opfor_switch2.png" alt="Half-Life: Opposing Force" /></a><strong>The Good:</strong> The beginning sequence of crash-landing at Black Mesa and receiving medical support from the Black Mesa staff that you were sent to suppress was a nice touch. Although the parallel narrative with Half-Life wasn’t particularly strong, there were a few inspired moments such as that one. Many of the gameplay strengths from Half-Life continue on in this game, and some weaknesses (like insipid jumping puzzles) were reduced or eliminated. Gearbox hit all of the typical expansion pack bullet points (More guns! More enemies! More stuff similar to stuff from last time!), which kinda worked both for and against Opposing Force.</p>

<p><strong>The Bad:</strong> The environments in Opposing Force tended to be smaller, and there were a number of elements to point to and say “that’s like a smaller version of (insert sequence in Half-Life)”. Opposing Force also didn’t hit what I call the “feels-like-a-real-place factor” like Half-Life did. Instead, OpFor had that video game-y “series of interconnected rooms with no real contextual relation” feeling. Half-Life often had areas with rooms linked together through common hallways, the way real buildings tend to be laid out. Opposing Force often went down the “here’s the hole to crawl through to get to the next area” path instead. Also, while the arsenal of new guns added some variety, some of them felt different just for the sake of being different.</p>

<p>Opposing Force was more Half-Life on a smaller scale, and with a bit less to offer in the narrative. If nothing else, it highlights the strengths of the original Half-Life title in being a fun game despite subtracting some interesting elements.</p>
