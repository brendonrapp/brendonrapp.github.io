  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing my posts about the <a href="http://www.gameconference.com">Austin Game Conference</a>&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/59261252/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/31/59261252_f85010c02f_m.jpg" alt="D201 - Bartle" /></a> Friday was kicked off with a keynote by <a href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/home.htm">Dr. Richard Bartle</a>, the co-creator of the original MUD (multi-user dungeon), and a professor at the University of Essex. Bartle is an exceedingly charming Englishman whose humor appealed to the geek crowd, without going overboard. Hopefully someone was recording a video of the keynote, because I want to see it again. Bartle titled his talk, &ldquo;Why Are We Here?&rdquo;. He informed us that &ldquo;You are all going to die&rdquo;, and with that knowledge of our own mortality, why did we find it so important to be there, in Austin, right then?</p>

<p>Bartle talked about MMOs (or &ldquo;virtual worlds&rdquo;, as he termed such games) as a powerful means of self-expression. MMOs empower players with a very strong sense of self, as their interaction with the world revolves around their created character. Also, their actions in the world primary effect the player&rsquo;s character (generally, you don&rsquo;t cause rapid changes in the game world through your actions - instead, the changes happen to your character). He also drew a parallel between MMO development and the old-school hackers of the &lsquo;60s and '70s. He claimed MMO developers largely subscribed to the same ethos as the old hackers - freedom of access, the right to be judged by your actions in the technology instead of outside of it, etc. Some of it was a bit of a stretch, but it was interesting nonetheless. It sounded a lot more plausible coming from him, I assure you.</p>

<p>The first session I attended was Microsoft&rsquo;s &ldquo;Introduction to XNA Studio&rdquo;. Microsoft appears to be doing some great things with the development pipeline. One thing they&rsquo;re trying to do is provide the same kind of content control to art assets as version control systems provide code. The XNA toolchain tracks the use of art resources, so that you&rsquo;ll know exactly what is relying on a certain model or texture, and will therefore be able to tell what changing that model or texture would affect. This has not traditionally been easy, and many developers have created in-house solutions to deal with problems like this. They also announced that an XNA beta will be made available at GDC in March 2006.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/59261253/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/29/59261253_b9795b96e0_m.jpg" alt="D202 - Casual" /></a>I only attended one other session on Friday, and that was the &ldquo;Casual Game Evolution Summit: Tech Today for Tomorrowâ€™s Hit&rdquo;. Basically, this panel included people from Sun and Macromedia, and talked up the usefulness of Java and Flash/Shockwave for the development of &ldquo;casual&rdquo; games. The Sun guy insisted that Java need not be relegated only to small, lightweight games - with Java&rsquo;s hooks into OpenGL, he stated that DOOM III could easily be written in Java. The discussion was focused on &ldquo;casual game&rdquo; development, though. Honestly, there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of meat in this session. Basically, each side told us about how much more widespread their technologies are than in the past (and it&rsquo;s true - Java and Flash and Shockwave penetration on home PCs is certainly up - especially Java, with the whole Microsoft VM deal behind them, and more and more Windows machines getting true Sun JRE installs). If you knew nothing about casual game development, you&rsquo;d leave knowing that Java and Shockwave are good platforms for such games. Probably not news to most people at the conference.</p>

<p>The rest of my time at the conference was spent at the tech pavilion. Here&rsquo;s a couple photo highlights:</p>

<p>I love this picture - Microsoft and Sony, right next to each other, living in sweet harmony:

<p>The giant elephant in the room was actually a gorilla - a mascot for GameTrust&rsquo;s &ldquo;Go Casual&rdquo; sessions:

<p>Microsoft had a separate &ldquo;casual games&rdquo; booth set up, where they displayed Xbox 360s playing some of the casual games that will be available on Xbox Live Arcade. Frankly, some of the stuff looked really neat, and I could easily see myself purchasing a few casual games to keep on my 360. I know Stacey will enjoy some of them:

<p>Hooray for PVS (potentially visible sets)!

<p>Next conference, I will be certain to have a decent camera with me. Too many of my pictures came out blurry, and even worse were the ones that I had to delete.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/58437154/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/31/58437154_a4824e90f1_m.jpg" alt="D111 - Convention" /></a> I attended the 2005 <a href="http://www.gameconference.com">Austin Game Conference</a> this past weekend. As I am in my final year of graduate school (until I eventually go back for a Ph.D), it has become time for me to start attending the job conferences and expos for the industry that I wish to enter. This was the first such conference I have gone to, and it was quite a revealing experience. Much of what I had thought to be true was confirmed, and I also learned some new things and got some ideas for future reference.</p>

<p>I stayed at the Radisson on E. Cesar Chavez Ave., right in the heart of downtown Austin (and a direct 3 block walk down the street from the convention center where the conference was held). My 12th floor room had a view overlooking the Colorado River, and was right by the famous Congress Bridge which is the home to <a href="http://www.austin360.com/recreation/content/events/special/bats.html">the largest bat colony in North America</a>. I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to see the bats, but someday soon I&rsquo;ll be back. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/58435925/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/28/58435925_6140379435_m.jpg" alt="D101 - Hotel" /></a></p>

<p>The conference began with a keynote speech by Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) President John Smedley. Smedley offered his vision of online games in the future:</p>

<p>(Abridged and paraphrased): A kid walks into a Starbuck&rsquo;s with his PSP. He turns it on and gets online in Untold Legends. No configuration hassle, the device just linked up to the T-Mobile hotspot and began. The kid plays with some net friends - but these friends are kids in Tokyo riding a train, playing the same game on their cell phones with GeForce2-level graphics chips (such phones are already on the market in Japan). Finally, the kid at Starbuck&rsquo;s goes home, and fires up his PS3. There, he gets on the same game, with the same character, and can continue playing with his Tokyo cell phone playing friends. Obviously, the game looks different on the PS3 than on the PSP or cell phones, but the game remains consistant and universal.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/58435926/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/26/58435926_56043bedaa_m.jpg" alt="D102 - Smedley" /></a> Along the way in explaining this vision, Smedley dropped the &ldquo;Leeroy Jenkins&rdquo; clip on us, as well as the &ldquo;chocolate milk kid&rdquo; clip, as examples of how player behavior poses a challenge in the development of these games (as Smedley said, having an ogre in EverQuest with the screaming kid&rsquo;s voice coming out of it would be incredibly distracting). He termed the challenge as &ldquo;solving the &lsquo;idiot&rsquo; problem&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Smedley also had some interesting things to say about the upcoming console generation. When it comes to storage, Smedley said, &ldquo;Guess what? Hard drives are optional on the next generation of consoles too. That doesn&rsquo;t make our job any easier, but we adapt.&rdquo; He offered some alternatives to hard drive storage, such as networked storage and streamable content. &ldquo;We hope we can get people to buy the hard drive kits on the next gen consoles, but we&rsquo;re not relying on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He finished his keynote with some thoughts on the business model of MMO games. Subscription costs have not gone over well in the console world. Alternative solutions, however, have something to offer. He first talked about the contraversial topic of item sales for MMO games. He spoke of Station Exchange, an auction service by SOE for EverQuest 2. He said that 33% of EQ2 players are signed up for the service, and that the &ldquo;secondary market&rdquo; that Station Exchange is a big part of pulls down $300-$500 million a year. What was once something that was banned and shunned has instead been embraced and turned into a proft stream. (That last sentence is my editorializing - Smedley left out the part about SOE&rsquo;s initial reaction to the &ldquo;secondary market&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Station Exchange is just an example of what Smedley called &ldquo;added value services&rdquo;. The idea is to make the game subscription free, but offer added value services to provide the income streams (beyond the initial game sale). He gave an example of a &ldquo;velvet rope&rdquo; bonus subscription for $5/month as something that could be offered.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/58435927/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/33/58435927_5d955d3552_m.jpg" alt="D103 - MMO Databases" /></a>After the keynote was a break, and then the first round of seminars. I attended a seminar named &ldquo;Relational Database Chices for MMOs&rdquo;. The panel featured four developers from companies that produced some major MMOs, including City of Heroes and Dark Age of Camelot. They talked about where they use relational databases, and equally important, where they do not. I was surprised to hear just how much many of their games rely on &ldquo;flat files&rdquo; for a number of data storage purposes. The major issue with relational databases, they told us, is the delay between the request for information, and the successful retrieval and return of that info. The databases are too slow for looking up information on-demand in real-time gameplay. Players expect their button press to be followed with action instantaneously, not button press, then a heartbeat&rsquo;s time, then action. In game elements where the instant response is not so important (such as an in-game auction house), then relational databases are an option. An interesting topic of conversation was the specific relational databases each company uses - two (including the devs for Dark Age of Camelot) use MySQL, while the other two (including the devs for City of Heroes) use Microsoft SQL. The guy from Mythic relayed a story about their inquiry on pricing for an Oracle database, which used to only be determined by number of users (which, for an MMO, is outrageously large). Oracle has since begun offering pricing per CPU, which makes it feasible for new MMO design now. One final note was something that the Mythic guy said about the industry&rsquo;s need for DBAs (database administrators). He said he knew plenty of companies where a DBA could walk into HR and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a DBA. Hire me.&rdquo;, and HR would answer, &ldquo;OK.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/58435928/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/33/58435928_4ada6270d2_m.jpg" alt="D104 - Xbox 360" /></a> At the end of that session was a lunch break. There was another round of sessions after lunch, but I sat that one out, as none of the lectures interested me, and I wanted a chance to roam the Tech Pavilion floor without the heavy traffic that exists in-between sessions. I got a chance to talk to some recruiters from a recruiting agency (&ldquo;As soon as you finish that master&rsquo;s, call us&rdquo;), as well as to some guys from BioWare and Microsoft. Alas, the BioWare guy pointed out that Canada isn&rsquo;t an option for me at this point due to visa laws (I have the requisite degree, but not the 2 years of industry work experience needed). The Microsoft guy asked for a copy of my resume and told me to be sure to hit up the recruiters that come to Fresno State.</p>

<p>Also at the Microsoft booth was an Xbox 360 kiosk. Let me tell you: that stuff you&rsquo;ve been hearing about 360 games looking like &ldquo;current gen&rdquo; games? Hogwash. Granted, it&rsquo;s not the monsterous leap forward that the current gen systems were from the hopelessly grainy and barely-able-to-do-3D systems like the old PSX, but the difference is obvious. All of the playable demos were running at a blazing 60 frames per second in 720p. You don&rsquo;t see that in screenshots, but the difference it makes when seeing it in action is obvious. It&rsquo;s silky smooth enough animation to confuse with reality, rather than just smooth enough to not be &ldquo;choppy&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s about time. Having games that don&rsquo;t dip down into choppiness during high action sequences is an important hurdle to get past in order to get closer to that ever-popular buzzword, &ldquo;immersion&rdquo;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/58435929/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/31/58435929_a1b2507848_m.jpg" alt="D105 - ATI" /></a> The next session I attended was ATI&rsquo;s &ldquo;Demo Team Secrets: The Next Generation&rdquo;. The ATI guy showed their <a href="http://www.ati.com/products/RadeonX1K/demos/toyshop.html">Toyshop Demo</a>, and went over some of the techniques used to create the effects in the demo. The demo uses a technique called <a href="http://ati.com/developer/SIGGRAPH05/Tatarchuk-ParallaxOcclusionMapping-Sketch-print.pdf">Parallax Occlusion Mapping</a>, which was developed by one of the ATI engineers and was a topic of a good chunk of the session. The demo also highlighted <a href="http://ati.com/developer/ShaderX2_IntroductionToHLSL.pdf">DirectX9 HLSL</a>, and some neat ideas for rendering rain in realtime cheaply. Hopefully, the presentation gets posted to their <a href="http://ati.com/developer/techpapers.html">Tech Papers &amp; Presentations</a> section of their website soon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63889707@N00/58435930/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/31/58435930_da53b83113_m.jpg" alt="D106 - IBM" /></a> The final session I attended on day 1 was &ldquo;IBM Processors and Technologies&rdquo;, in which the topic of discussion was not the Cell processor, but rather the CPU used in the Xbox 360. A bunch of details on the processor was released within the past few days, so this presentation was pretty close to the debut of a lot of information. I&rsquo;m not a hardware engineer, so this wasn&rsquo;t all quite up my alley, but I did get something out of the session. One of the topics of discussion was the contraversial decision of using inorder execution (as opposed to out-of-order execution, which allows for the rearrangement of commands at the instruction level, in order to minimize pipeline stalls and such.) IBM made it clear that this was a customer requirement (as in, Microsoft, and Sony for the Cell). They also said that inorder execution permits more predictable performance for the processors, and that multi-threaded processors like these benefit less from out-of-order execution - instructions that would stall everything behind it on a single core chip can be executed on a different core, while the instructions behind it can execute on a different core.</p>

<p>After the conference ended, it was time to hit the streets of Austin. Though, without any vehicle transportation, I wasn&rsquo;t really going far. But I did enjoy some sights on the way back to the hotel:</p>

<p>Those id guys roll in style:

<p>Austin is truly a beautiful city:

<p>I&rsquo;m not used to a city downtown that&rsquo;s so&hellip; clean:

<p>I hold the line:

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am typing this from downtown Austin, TX. But we&rsquo;ll get to that part later.</p>

<p>Last week, the gaming gods saw fit to bestow SOCOM III unto us. And it is good. Probably one of the last three PS2 games I will really play (the others being Shadow of the Colossus and, if Play Magazine is to be believed, Dragon Quest 8). The game has lived up to my expectations. Granted, I got a sneak peek with the online beta, but that was only one map. The rest of the game is of even higher quality than what we saw in the beta. When it comes to my online shooter time, I&rsquo;m left saying, &ldquo;Halo who?&rdquo; (No, Kristyn, this does not mean you will be able to defeat me.)</p>

<p>Also, I had a brutal midterm and an assignment to complete for a couple of my classes. I spent the first part of the week doing nothing but studying and taking occasional SOCOM breaks. When Friday came, I was happy. All I had to do was go to work, and after that, I was free - with a hockey game to go to that evening.</p>

<p>Then, as I sat in idle traffic on Nees Ave., some idiot girl rammed into our lane of traffic, causing the person behind me to hit into me and damage the whole back end of my car. This set of a flurry of insurance activity (given the fact that there are four participants and 3 insurance companies involved and all) that continues still. My back was sore for two days, but some rest and hockey-induced adrenaline chased that away.</p>

<p>So with all that behind me, I left Fresno today (well, Wednesday) for Austin to attend the <a href="http://www.gameconference.com">Austin Game Developer&rsquo;s Conference</a>. On my flight, I overheard some other attendees-to-be. Indeed, there seem to be many staying here in this Radisson Hotel, three blocks from the Convention Center where the conference is being held. My goal, of course, is to offer myself up to the recruiters, seeing as I am finishing school after next semester. Although this may end up being more of a dress rehearsal for next March&rsquo;s conference in San Jose, where I will have some demo work to present (instead of just a resume), it will still prove to be a valuable learning and preparatory experience. Plus, it will give me material to pull from for my research writing class. Anything on top of all of that is a great bonus.</p>

<p>My flight from Fresno to Dallas was long, but my PSP made the time pass quickly. On Tuesday, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories released for the PSP. I ran out and got the last copy that GameStop had, in preparation for my flight. It was a good move, as the game is excellent. It&rsquo;s basically GTA3 on the PSP. Some new content and tweaks that have occured in the series since then are present, of course. I was always more keen on Liberty City as a GTA setting than any of the others, so I&rsquo;m pleased with the return there in this game. The only danger now is that I might go out of my way to play it in situations where I wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise play my handheld games, and I&rsquo;ll run out of it before the next trip I take.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ll be posting a bunch of pictures and notes from the conference here. Thank goodness for free WiFi Internet access in the lobby.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, I did something that I have not done in many, many years.</p>

<p>I bought comic books.</p>

<p>I used to read comics a long time ago. I was always a fan of the X-Men family of books. The biggest problem was that the books got too numerous and convoluted. Uncanny X-Men, X-Men, X-Force, Excalibur, X-Factor, Generation X, X-<em>Man</em>, Wolverine, Cable&hellip; when you&rsquo;re 14, it&rsquo;s not quite so hard to follow them all and keep things straight, but eventually it seemed like even more books were being added and it just became a whole mess.</p>

<p>Today, it appears a lot less complicated. There seems to be a small core of &ldquo;main continuity&rdquo; books and some popular &ldquo;alternate timeline&rdquo; books. The most popular of the main timeline books appears to be Astonishing X-Men, written by Firefly creator Joss Whedon. Over the past couple of days, I picked up a paperback book containing Astonishing X-men #1-6 as well as individual issues 9-12 (couldn&rsquo;t find 7 and 8 ). I also picked up the three Serenity comics that Whedon wrote to bridge the time between the TV series and the movie (though, in reality, it doesn&rsquo;t focus much on doing so). And a couple of weeks ago, I bought a &ldquo;Marvel Masterworks&rdquo; paperback that chronicles the end of the original X-Men team, and the formation of the &ldquo;newer&rdquo; squad (Wolverine, Colossus, Storm, etc).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not collecting comics like Derek, but just maybe I&rsquo;ll find a place for a regular few to read.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my main fantasy football league, I am the 2nd highest scoring team. Yet I am 1-3.
In my secondary league, I am the 3rd highest scoring team. Yet I am 2-2.
In my tertiary league, I am the 4th highest scoring team. Yet I am 2-2.</p>

<p>Never before have I wanted rotisserie-style leagues so badly. I just drafted in a fantasy hockey league that&rsquo;s point-based instead of head-to-head. So I&rsquo;m certain that I will score lowly here.</p>

<p>This post is also a test of a new Myspace cross-post plugin. Does this show up on Myspace? I&rsquo;ll find out in a moment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Football weather&rdquo; is finally starting to peek its head into the Valley. We had a nice little rainstorm early in the week.  Weather.com still has warm weather for us for the next week and a half though. It&rsquo;s damn near October, get this Valley heat the hell away from us already.</p>

<p>This year, I am following college football more closely than before. I have followed Fresno State closely since coming here, but now I am trying to follow the rest of the NCAA as well. Right now, Oregon is up 10-0 on USC. How long do you think that will last? Fresno gets their shot at USC late in the season, would be nice if SC was still undefeated, just to preserve a slim chance of Fresno getting to be the world-shockers.</p>

<p>I also am paying more attention to hockey. I&rsquo;m definitely looking forward to the new &amp; improved NHL this year, and I will be at a lot more Fresno Falcons games this season than I was last year. Lots of LA Kings games on FOX Sports West this year, I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>

<p>SOCOM III is coming. October 11th. Be prepared, or die.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fantasy football has begun. 3 day weekend, 3 drafts for me. The &ldquo;real life&rdquo; league that I&rsquo;ve run for years now, and two online leagues based around the GamersWithJobs.com website.</p>

<p>Stacey has joined our &ldquo;real life&rdquo; league for the first time. She got her first taste of a fantasy football draft.</p>

<p>Today, she informed me that she&rsquo;s worried about one of her players, Titans running back Chris Brown - whom she has learned is injury-prone.</p>

<p>I love her so much.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the last few hours, I have been upgrading my little file server / router, APOLLO, to Linux kernel 2.6. I&rsquo;ve been running it at 2.4 long enough.</p>

<p>APOLLO is a little Celeron 466, 128MB RAM machine, with a 10GB drive for the OS (Gentoo Linux) and two 120GB drives for my music collection &amp; other files.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also working on implementing traffic shaping with <em>iptables</em> and <em>iproute2</em> (tc), to help prioritize online gaming packets (much like those hardware &ldquo;gaming routers&rdquo; on the market). Have had some success so far. APOLLO&rsquo;s quite the old trooper, and it&rsquo;s time for him to learn a few new tricks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&rsquo;t really wanted to post in a while, mainly because I didn&rsquo;t care to move those Shirley Manson pictures off the top of the page. I am of the mind that an attractive female gripping her own chest is, how you say, <em>hot.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve teetered between indifference and addiction in World of Warcraft, sometimes going back and forth in the same day. At its best, World of Warcraft is a very enjoyable virtual online world to be in. I&rsquo;m convinced that more people could force themselves through the daily grind of real life more readily if they were awarded experience points every step of the way, and created social castes around a person&rsquo;s <em>level</em>. Although such a system could easily be considered an allegory for how things really are, albeit one much more transparent (and in our world, some bastards are just <em>born</em> into Level 50)</p>

<p>My virtual Jacksonville Jaguars continue to dominate the playing field in their online league, standing at 7-0. My first team offense is getting less and less field time, as I want to keep Byron Leftwich and Fred Taylor healthy for the postseason.</p>

<p>NHL hockey has been <em>NUTS</em> since the lockout ended. The Kings now have Pavol Demitra, Jeremy Roenick, and Valeri Bure to add to Craig Conroy, Alexander Frolov, Luc Robitaille, Dustin Brown, and Mike Cammalleri to choose top 6 forwards from. Definitely better scoring depth than they&rsquo;ve had in a while, though I miss Jason Allison. Hopefully Cammy and Brown can challenge Bure and Robitaille for 2nd line time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m knee deep in NFL preseason football, watching virtually every game on tape delay. It&rsquo;s time to prepare for football season. :)</p>
