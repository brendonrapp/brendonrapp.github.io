  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, I did something that I have not done in many, many years.</p>

<p>I bought comic books.</p>

<p>I used to read comics a long time ago. I was always a fan of the X-Men family of books. The biggest problem was that the books got too numerous and convoluted. Uncanny X-Men, X-Men, X-Force, Excalibur, X-Factor, Generation X, X-_Man_, Wolverine, Cable… when you’re 14, it’s not quite so hard to follow them all and keep things straight, but eventually it seemed like even more books were being added and it just became a whole mess.</p>

<p>Today, it appears a lot less complicated. There seems to be a small core of “main continuity” books and some popular “alternate timeline” books. The most popular of the main timeline books appears to be Astonishing X-Men, written by Firefly creator Joss Whedon. Over the past couple of days, I picked up a paperback book containing Astonishing X-men #1-6 as well as individual issues 9-12 (couldn’t find 7 and 8 ). I also picked up the three Serenity comics that Whedon wrote to bridge the time between the TV series and the movie (though, in reality, it doesn’t focus much on doing so). And a couple of weeks ago, I bought a “Marvel Masterworks” paperback that chronicles the end of the original X-Men team, and the formation of the “newer” squad (Wolverine, Colossus, Storm, etc).</p>

<p>I’m not collecting comics like Derek, but just maybe I’ll find a place for a regular few to read.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my main fantasy football league, I am the 2nd highest scoring team. Yet I am 1-3.
In my secondary league, I am the 3rd highest scoring team. Yet I am 2-2.
In my tertiary league, I am the 4th highest scoring team. Yet I am 2-2.</p>

<p>Never before have I wanted rotisserie-style leagues so badly. I just drafted in a fantasy hockey league that’s point-based instead of head-to-head. So I’m certain that I will score lowly here.</p>

<p>This post is also a test of a new Myspace cross-post plugin. Does this show up on Myspace? I’ll find out in a moment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>“Football weather” is finally starting to peek its head into the Valley. We had a nice little rainstorm early in the week.  Weather.com still has warm weather for us for the next week and a half though. It’s damn near October, get this Valley heat the hell away from us already.</p>

<p>This year, I am following college football more closely than before. I have followed Fresno State closely since coming here, but now I am trying to follow the rest of the NCAA as well. Right now, Oregon is up 10-0 on USC. How long do you think that will last? Fresno gets their shot at USC late in the season, would be nice if SC was still undefeated, just to preserve a slim chance of Fresno getting to be the world-shockers.</p>

<p>I also am paying more attention to hockey. I’m definitely looking forward to the new &amp; improved NHL this year, and I will be at a lot more Fresno Falcons games this season than I was last year. Lots of LA Kings games on FOX Sports West this year, I can’t wait.</p>

<p>SOCOM III is coming. October 11th. Be prepared, or die.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Fantasy football has begun. 3 day weekend, 3 drafts for me. The “real life” league that I’ve run for years now, and two online leagues based around the GamersWithJobs.com website.</p>

<p>Stacey has joined our “real life” league for the first time. She got her first taste of a fantasy football draft.</p>

<p>Today, she informed me that she’s worried about one of her players, Titans running back Chris Brown - whom she has learned is injury-prone.</p>

<p>I love her so much.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the last few hours, I have been upgrading my little file server / router, APOLLO, to Linux kernel 2.6. I’ve been running it at 2.4 long enough.</p>

<p>APOLLO is a little Celeron 466, 128MB RAM machine, with a 10GB drive for the OS (Gentoo Linux) and two 120GB drives for my music collection &amp; other files.</p>

<p>I’m also working on implementing traffic shaping with <em>iptables</em> and <em>iproute2</em> (tc), to help prioritize online gaming packets (much like those hardware “gaming routers” on the market). Have had some success so far. APOLLO’s quite the old trooper, and it’s time for him to learn a few new tricks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven’t really wanted to post in a while, mainly because I didn’t care to move those Shirley Manson pictures off the top of the page. I am of the mind that an attractive female gripping her own chest is, how you say, <em>hot.</em></p>

<p>I’ve teetered between indifference and addiction in World of Warcraft, sometimes going back and forth in the same day. At its best, World of Warcraft is a very enjoyable virtual online world to be in. I’m convinced that more people could force themselves through the daily grind of real life more readily if they were awarded experience points every step of the way, and created social castes around a person’s <em>level</em>. Although such a system could easily be considered an allegory for how things really are, albeit one much more transparent (and in our world, some bastards are just <em>born</em> into Level 50)</p>

<p>My virtual Jacksonville Jaguars continue to dominate the playing field in their online league, standing at 7-0. My first team offense is getting less and less field time, as I want to keep Byron Leftwich and Fred Taylor healthy for the postseason.</p>

<p>NHL hockey has been <em>NUTS</em> since the lockout ended. The Kings now have Pavol Demitra, Jeremy Roenick, and Valeri Bure to add to Craig Conroy, Alexander Frolov, Luc Robitaille, Dustin Brown, and Mike Cammalleri to choose top 6 forwards from. Definitely better scoring depth than they’ve had in a while, though I miss Jason Allison. Hopefully Cammy and Brown can challenge Bure and Robitaille for 2nd line time.</p>

<p>I’m knee deep in NFL preseason football, watching virtually every game on tape delay. It’s time to prepare for football season. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My flight is now booked for Austin, TX, to attend the <a href="http://www.gameconference.com">Austin Game Conference</a> on October 27-28.</p>

<p>I’m very much looking forward to returning to Austin. My time there a few weeks ago wasn’t much beyond driving around the city and seeing what’s there. Although I’ll see even less of the city this time, I will be staying downtown and walking to the Conference at the convention center.</p>

<p>Between this and the Game Developer’s Conference in San Jose (next March), I’ll be able to attend at least two trade conferences before finishing school. Maybe I’ll find a couple of non-game development conferences to attend as well. As much as I would like to be able to work in Austin, I have to be open to going anywhere in the country. Eventually I’ll earn the right to pick and choose where I go, and I’ll probably work my way back towards Austin if I’m not there already. But until then, as much as Stacey doesn’t want to hear it, anywhere is a possibility. San Francisco, Seattle, San Jose, New York, Boston, Vancouver, Montreal, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Chicago, Portland, Houston, San Diego? Anywhere and everywhere are possibilities, though the three most likely places are California (Bay/LA/San Diego), Washington (Seattle/Redmond), and Texas (Austin/San Antonio/Houston).</p>

<p>But when you’re starting at the bottom, you have to go where the work is. Choosing where to go is a luxury earned later.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>GameFly brought me a pair of new Xbox releases in the form of Destroy All Humans! and Conker: Live and Reloaded.</p>

<p>Destroy All Humans is a tale of a great game that wasn’t quite. I am reminded of a quote from someone on the Halo development team, who talked about how the core of one’s game boils down to 30 seconds of gameplay. Those 30 seconds you will experience over and over again. In Halo’s case, for example, those 30 seconds contain shooting, dodging, and piloting vehicles. You play those same 30 seconds over and over - the locations and context change, but the actions remain largely the same. So, the Halo dev’s point was, you have to nail those 30 seconds to make a great game.</p>

<p>Destroy All Humans nails the 30 seconds, but proves that it takes more than just that to make a great game. There is sheer gameplay joy to find in Destroy All Humans. Your alien character is capable of, among other things, lifting and throwing creatures, people, and objects telekinetically. There’s an aspect of thrilling discovery involved when you find that, yes, you CAN lift the guy up and repeatedly slam him into the ground to kill him. Or, lift him waaaaaaay up and let go, and just let gravity do the rest. And, one might say that you haven’t truly [i]lived[/i] until you have telekinetically thrown a cow (radioactive or otherwise) at your attackers and let the bovine’s mass do the dirty work.</p>

<p>Sadly, while the core gameplay is a blast, the game doesn’t provide a varied enough framework for it. Occasionally, you get to enjoy some real ingenious sequences (such as taking on the appearance of a town’s mayor, and speaking to the townspeople to calm their fears… that is, if you choose dialogue options like “Blame Communists” and resist the temptation of ones such as “Enslave Human Populace”). Most of the time, however, you’re doing the same sorts of tasks over and over, and getting shot at by one too many offscreen enemies. As the game ramps up the challenge, it forgets that the feeling of being a near-indestructable badass alien is what makes the game fun. When the enemies are capable of putting up too frantic of a fight to allow you to enjoy the fun of your abilities, things get less interesting.</p>

<p>As for Conker, well, there’s one beautiful looking game. Infuriatingly, however, the camera control issues of the original game are still largely present. Also present is the fact that the game is, by and large, a platformer - and despite my love of the witty yet horribly crude humor, I found that I still don’t enjoy 3D platformers very much. Except for Psychonauts, though Psychonauts managed to be as much of a 3D action/adventure game as it was a platformer.</p>

<p>Anyway, both games are going back in the mail tomorrow. I might try Conker again in the future, but right now there are some new releases that are a bit more up my alley that I want to get my hands on…</p>
