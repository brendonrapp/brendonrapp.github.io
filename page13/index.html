  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been increasingly dissatisfied with Play Magazine in recent months. I grow tired of the constant over-coverage of any anime-licensed game, and the high scores for these often barely-functional pieces of junk.</p>

<p>The last straw, as one might put it, is Dave Halverson’s review of Sonic the Hedgehog, another barely-functional game, this one for the Xbox 360.</p>

<p>Most media outlets gave the game a very low score, below a 5 out of 10. Halverson gave the game a 9.5. Now, bucking conventional opinion isn’t a crime. However, this, like many other platformer games in the past, reeks of Halverson fanboyism. Halverson later fessed to the fact that his review copy had the same insane loading times that the final game did, yet because he was promised these would be fixed in the final game, he did not account for them in his review. Of course, optimization is among the final processes a piece of software goes through, and reviewing not-quite-complete game code requires taking this into account. Still, some degree of critical thinking is required, rather than taking the promise at face value. Halverson later updated his review, adjusting the score to a still quite laughable 8.5.</p>

<p>Even all of that isn’t enough to make me stop reading. Sure, Halverson is entitled to his opinion, even if that opinion is so rose-colored as to be nearly useless to anyone not named Dave Halverson (which is a problem when it comes to reviews). Here is the real problem, in Halverson’s updated review:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sonic isnâ€™t for everybodyâ€”itâ€™s for fans. Just as a game like SOCOM or Medal of Honor 10 is for fans. <strong>Iâ€™d give any military FPS a 3-5 tops for the sheer fact that theyâ€™re so very tired, not to mention packed with realistic killingâ€¦which is why I donâ€™t review military FPS titles</strong>. I donâ€™t like them but I respect the opinions of people that do enough not to insult them. <strong>Shame the door doesnâ€™t swing both ways.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had to basically pick my jaw up off the floor after reading that. Suddenly, everything makes sense. Although a truly “objective” review is impossible, as personal opinions and biases will always factor in, any reasonable reviewer (or even game fan) should be able to recognize intrinsic level of quality in a product that isn’t necessarily one’s favorite genre. A “professional” reviewer claiming that an entire genre would get no better than “a 3-5 tops”, and then trying to justify that mentality by saying “that’s why I don’t review them” would be a joke if it weren’t so unfunny. (I also love the claim that the genre is “so very tired”, as if 3D platformers like Sonic aren’t every bit as “tired”). As someone who is very soured on Japanese console RPGs, I could not imagine claiming that I would never give such a game a high score just because I don’t like the genre. It’s not hard to recognize quality. A critic should recognize his own biases, but also recognize a good product even if it’s not in line with those personal biases. That would be called “being a professional”.</p>

<p>And then there’s the kicker at the end. Halverson erects a nice straw man by confessing his own biases, and then obliterates it by implying that those who pan Sonic are just biased against it - but worse, they aren’t confessing them and thus are intellectually dishonest.</p>

<p>It’s become crystal clear that Halverson has no concept of being a professional. Some accuse him of being a hype factory for his precious platformers, regardless of whatever the actual reality of those games may be. I don’t know if Halverson deludes himself into buying into his own excitement for the game, or if he truly does like the games as much as he says he does. What is obvious, though, is that he lacks the clear, rational, even-handed critical thought to write reviews that are of use to anyone else. Because, as some forget, that is the point of printed reviews. That is why people spend $5 to buy the magazine - to get reviews that are useful to THEM, not to read a Dave Halverson love-letter in the guise of a review. A review needs to be informative to the reader. Failing to point out the myriad of flaws and even game-damaging bugs games like Sonic the Hedgehog have make Halverson’s reviews a complete failure at what should be their intended purpose: informing potential customers. A game review written for any other purpose is not a review at all.</p>

<p>So, I am voting with my dollars. Once my Play subscription lapses (very soon), that will be the end of that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I performed a little test. I wanted to see how well a DVD upscaled to 1080i looked compared with a non-upscaled DVD, as well as compared with the same thing in true HD.</p>

<p>I took my Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers DVD, and loaded up The Two Towers in HD on demand through Comcast cable.</p>

<p>I played the movie on my Xbox 360 DVD player (480p), on my Philips upscaling DVD (480p upscaled to 1080i), and then the HD Comcast version (1080i).</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the HD version was the most detailed, and the non-upscaled DVD was the least sharp.</p>

<p>Where my interest lied is where the upscaled DVD fell on this spectrum. Happily, it was closer to the HD picture than the non-upscaled DVD picture.</p>

<p>CNet warned that upscaling “doesn’t do miracles”, but I was pleased with the marked improvement in sharpness in the upscaled DVD picture. This was especially evident in the menu screen before the movie loaded, where one could view black text on a white-ish background, and really compare the sharpness. The upscaled DVD was much sharper than the non-upscaled DVD, and rivaled the HD picture.</p>

<p>During actual scenes, subtle detail appeared in the HD picture that did not appear (or at least was not as pronounced) in even the upscaled DVD image.</p>

<p>Granted, this test was not perfect - only the upscaling DVD player was connected via HDMI, the other two devices were connected via component. But HDMI doesn’t automatically mean a better picture, either.
It may not do “miracles”, but this little unscientific test made me glad that I got an upscaling DVD player. It’s impressive, and makes me wonder how necessary HD-DVD and Blu-Ray really are (certainly an improvement, but not one that’s going to have me replacing my old DVDs anytime soon - maybe NEXT format war)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Got an HDTV? Then you probably have (or need) some HDMI cables. HDMI cables are the preferred means of connecting video equipment to HD-enabled display devices. They’re digital and offer the highest quality available.</p>

<p>Problem is, they’re expensive. Unnecessarily expensive. At Best Buy, they start from about $60 and go up from there.</p>

<p>A website called monoPrice.com, however, sells 6’ HDMI cables for about $5.</p>

<p>Five bucks? They have to be crap, right?</p>

<p>Nope. With digital signals, cable “quality” is less of an issue. But most importantly, there’s no reason for HDMI cables to cost $60-100 anyway. High-end video people are used to spending big on cables (which, in the analog days, WAS necessary for top quality), and so cable manufacturers are all too willing to mark cables up high, even if they don’t belong at that price.</p>

<p>The people at AVS Forums (a hardcore A/V crowd) love the monoPrice cables.</p>

<p>So, don’t get fooled into paying sky-high prices for HDMI or DVI cables. The markups above $10 are just pure profit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Something new I have decided to do with this page is to post things I read online that I find to be insightful, or at least a concise bit of knowledge or opinion found in my travels through the internet ether. Some of them may be obvious to some people, but others may find something of interest in them.
This comes from Jun-Dai from the Criterion forums, on the topic of high-definition video disc (Blu-Ray, HD-DVD) adoption:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I’ll eat my hat if DVD isn’t the highest quality home video format in the US with more than 10% adoption for the next five years at least. The format war isn’t the biggest of the obstacles, but it’s definitely an obstacle. People simply aren’t ready for another format, and more importantly, the higher quality formats offer nothing over DVD other than quality, whereas DVD offered a good deal over the previous formats (in order of importance: small form factor, no degradation, improved video quality, easy access to favorite scenes/no rewinding, all DVD players play CDs, and special features).</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>“So <em>Legion</em>”, you say, “tell me something about games!”</p>

<p>Happy to.</p>

<p>First off, if you don’t own an <strong>Xbox 360</strong>, please remedy that fact now (Ryan! Greg!). The 360 has quickly pushed its way to the center of my gaming world. The number of games both out and coming out for it make it irresistible, especially for online play.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter (Xbox 360):</strong> I played through the single player campaign when it came out. It was pretty good. But I’ve recently starting playing it online again. It’s pretty sharp, and runs great online (unlike the last Clancy shooter I tried online, Rainbow Six 3).</p>

<p><strong>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (Xbox 360):</strong> I’m an Elder Scrolls fan back from Daggerfall, and though Morrowind didn’t quite work out for me, this game has. It’s a joy just to ride a horse through the lush, green world. I had a problem with this game when I first got it. I didn’t like the fact that enemies level up in accordance to your level. I felt like there was no advancing in the game. I even asked, “what’s the point?”. Eventually, it hit me - like a non-RPG, the point is to go from one place to another and experience the content. It’s funny how we can get hung up on existing conventions and expectations. This is one game worth full price.</p>

<p><strong>Rainbow Six: Vegas (Xbox 360):</strong> This will be my next online shooter. The videos I’ve watched look fantastic, and the single-player demo is fun. I hope they’ve gotten past the lag issues of the last Rainbow Six I played online.</p>

<p><strong>Gears of War (Xbox 360):</strong> What I’ve heard from interviews on podcasts is that this is going to have some great online gameplay twists, but the meat of the game is an awesome sci-fi single player shooter experience. I’m dying to play this one.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.everybody-dies.com/screenshots/screenshot3.jpg"><img src="http://www.everybody-dies.com/screenshots/t_screenshot3.jpg" alt="" /></a><strong>Defcon (PC):</strong> Nuclear war is probably one of my favorite topics for entertainment. Defcon scratches that itch. It’s a game that “simulates” nuclear war, played out entirely on a “command room” world map screen, like something from WarGames. You don’t see any realistic graphics, just little insignias representing cities, missile silos, ships, submarines, and everything else needed to wage nuclear war. The premise is simple - nuke your opponents’ populations to hell while trying to keep as many of yours alive as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Splinter Cell: Double Agent (Xbox 360): **This was the most disappointing single player Splinter Cell ever. It was still good, but not **great</strong> like Chaos Theory. The multiplayer, however, is a new streamlined version of the Splinter Cell “spies vs. mercenaries” multiplayer that’s been part of the series since Pandora Tomorrow. It’s a lot easier to get into, but I’m not sure how much lasting power it will have.</p>

<p><strong>Club House Games (Nintendo DS):</strong> Do you have a DS? Get this game! It’s shockingly good.  It’s 42 little card, board, and other touch screen games. Does a game with little versions of poker, blackjack, bowling, chess, backgammon, darts, and some unique mini games like “word balloon” sound fun? It doesn’t? Well, it really is. None of the games are meaty enough to be worth attention by themselves. But a game that sends you jumping from one little game to the next, it actually is the perfect “pick up and go” DS game. Did I mention it has online play and single-cart local wireless? It’s the ultimate DS time killer.</p>

<p><strong>DOOM (Xbox 360):</strong> The original DOOM was released on Xbox Live Arcade. I can’t believe how much I’ve played that damn game. I’ll play multiplayer with anyone else that has it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Lose</strong> is what you do when you’re not winning.</p>

<p><strong>Loose</strong> is what something is when it’s not tight.</p>

<p>Losing is the process of not winning. Loosing is not a damn word at all.
I’d had quite enough of people getting this wrong. It’s bad enough on message boards. What has pushed me over the edge now is the fact that the game Splinter Cell: Double Agent incorrectly has “loosing” in place of EVERY instance of the word “losing”. It’s not just a lone typo. It’s a localization team that couldn’t pass 2nd grade spelling.</p>

<p>If you are reading this, and I’m sure very few people are… please do not get this wrong again. Ever. Please.</p>

<p>Because of her, I can not watch Studio 60 or Entourage when they’ve been freshly taped - I must wait for her to come over and watch too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.mobiletracker.net/archives/images/palm-treo-650-thumb.jpg" alt="" /> After my last piece of junk cell phone broke (the <a href="http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details.jsp?globalObjectId=55">Motorola V180</a>), I decided to get out of the “buying whatever phone Cingular offers cheapest” rat race and buy myself a cell phone worthy of owning.</p>

<p>That phone is the Palm Treo 650. I bought a slightly used (but in fantastic shape) Treo off of eBay.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://www.chatteremail.com/">Chatter Email</a>, my email gets “pushed” to my cell phone, Blackberry style.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://www.pdaapps.com/verichat/">VeriChat</a>, I have a multi-network IM client right on my phone. Even when my phone is asleep with the screen off, I’m still logged into AIM and ICQ in the background, and when someone messages me, my phone wakes and alerts me.</p>

<p>With the included Blazer web browser, I’ve got an awfully nice bite-sized web browser. I’ve bookmarked a number of PDA-friendly websites (ESPN’s “PocketPC” version of their site, Amazon Anywhere, AOL Moviefone WAP, and others).</p>

<p>It’s great. Cingular offers unlimited Internet access for $20, and it’s excellent. It’s not a 3G phone so I can’t get on those super-fast data networks like Verizon’s EVDO, but my next smartphone will. As it is, going from regular junky phone to any kind of usable Internet access at all is quite a jump, and Cingular’s EDGE network is just fine for email, IM, and some on-the-spot web browsing.</p>

<p>I’d love a higher quality camera (it only has a VGA, 0.3 megapixel camera), and faster data support, and maybe a better web browser (Blazer is nice but slow, other browsers on the Palm are either fast and ugly or fast and crashy-unstable). I know I will upgrade a year or so from now and look back and wonder how I lived with some of the “lacking” features. But right now, I’m giddy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this week, EA released Madden 07 for the Xbox, PS2, Xbox 360, and a bunch of other platforms.</p>

<p>I initially picked up the Xbox 360 version, only to end up replacing it with the plain ol’ Xbox version.</p>

<p>What’s the difference? Well, they’re basically different games. The 360 version is very disappointing, while the Xbox version (while not as pretty) plays much better.</p>

<p>The flaws with the 360 game are numerous. First, the game has a terrible default camera angle, which is way too low and makes it unnecessarily difficult to seeÂ  the sidelines or downfield (and judge distances). Next, the control is highly inferior to the Xbox game. You have much more precise control over your players on the Xbox. MUCH more precise. Furthermore, passing control is shoddy on the 360, lacking the exact pass placement ability of the Xbox. Some minor bugs and glitches on the 360 version add a thin layer of crap to the foundation that just doesn’t hold up to scrutiny when compared to the other version of the game bearing the same name.</p>

<p>If you want to play Madden, get it for the Xbox or PS2. It’s not just the better version, but it’s a GREAT football game - the first one since NFL2K5. It lacks the more “realistic” graphics and the presentation isn’t as shiny, but it’s such a great game to play. Best Madden since the Super NES.</p>
